I was hospitalized for a serious health problem and had to inform my manager that I would be out for work. I applied for a leave of absence and it was approved. When the incident happened, I called her to tell her I was unable to come to work, she asked why and I told her my personal medical business. I was not aware at the time that I did not need to give her my personal medical information. I trusted her with this information and never thought she would tell anyone we worked with...especially my personal health information. Is this some sort of HIPPA violation?

AskHR,1oz1jp9,2025-11-17T00:09:57+00:00,1,4,[CO] UPDATE: [CO Retention bonus with performance goal caveats],"Update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/s/XFVcXQJCN2

So I ended up declining the “retention”agreement mentioned in the previous post. That lit a few managers’ heads on fire. It was kinda fun being asked by panicky leaders why I declined. As if any answer would make them less worried. 

A few weeks after declining the agreement, I interviewed at a competitor. At the same time, the other heavy lifter on my team quit. I ended up getting quite a decent offer from the competing company. I brought the offer to the director of my org, going three levels above my manager’s head. I was given a ten percent raise and triple the previous “retention” agreement amounts but at six months and one year out rather than one and two years. 

Here we are a bit more than a year later. I’ve over delivered on all terms of the agreement and gotten my money. HR gave me zero raise this year, since I was given such a substantial raise at the end of last year. But the VP of my org has just delivered an additional, unprompted “retention” agreement for the next two years, this time with substantial equity. 

Meanwhile, the company has gone down the toilet. We’ve lost more key ICs and hired a bunch of people that don’t do any productive work. The equity feels like a joke. I’ll be leaving for a different competitor after the holidays and a 30% increase in TC. 

What does this sub think? Was it still the right decision by HR and execs to insult one of your few remaining high performers with “retention” agreements?

AskHR,1oz020u,2025-11-16T23:03:37+00:00,0,9,[CA] Inconsistencies in enforcement of policies.,"A couple of months ago I got in trouble for being consistently late to work which is a mistake that I hold on to and take full responsibility for. However, despite me being late and not having to take PTO, I was still meeting my job requirements. 

I work for the government and our inspections are contractually based in certain time blocks. So while it may not take you an hour to do an inspection in some cases, 10 to 15 minutes, you can enter that in as 1 hour as the seniors do in my division. This will be important in a second. 

My boss and her boss basically were happy that I cleaned up my app but then I had a question for them which is why is it okay for seniors in my division to have the ability to VPN that they're in the field and not show up 2 to 3 hours into their shift and still be able to leave at the end of their assigned shift? Or have other senior employees come to work on time but then leave 1 to 2 hours early because they're done with her full day of hours early. And they're done early just like I am. Most day is because of how we enter in our times for inspections. And I was pretty much told to sit down and shut up. It's not your concern. Am I in the wrong here for questioning their inconsistencies? 

Just last Friday my boss put me in a compromising situation where she asked me to stay late to go over something, and I didn't know how to respond with it's 4:30. I'd like to go home and while she did mention then we can go over this on Tuesday. In the heat of the moment it does sound bad to say no right because it'll only take just a second. 

My boss is pretty non-confrontational, and the seniors that I work with were also the employees/coworkers of my boss and it makes me feel that she's afraid to enforce policies on them because she was at one time not only trained by these employees, but we're friends with them via being an inspector. Because even after asking about the inconsistencies I've had senior employees ask me to help them with a customer picking up some work we had done for them because they may not have been available and it was just them them leaving early.  

What is the proper steps for me to do in this situation? Because I get told that I talk too much, or sometimes I'm on my phone yet. Last year I was so efficient at my workload that I ended up bleeding over to three other employees work in that program to help clean it up and all I got was a thank you. I feel like maybe and doing it in my time realistically would just result in me like being done with my years worth of work in 4 months and why should I work harder when you have employees doing half the effort and getting praise for it and getting paid $12 to $15 more than me per hour.

Outside of this though, the job itself is pretty low-key.  My boss doesn't micromanage me, she wants to help me succeed in different programs. I just don't like the feeling of ostracization. There's an employee who's been known to not even show up to the office for 2 to 3 weeks at a time because they use VPN to say there in the field have their work keys with them and then gets their job done, essentially getting paid to commute to work and then leave during work hours. 

Am I in the wrong here? Is this just the kind of environment where I just take it on the chin that they're looking at me and I come to work on time get done with my day's worth of work early and then just hide in my car and watch TV or read books till the end of my shift so it doesn't look like I'm not busy? Is there an actual case here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oz020u/ca_inconsistencies_in_enforcement_of_policies/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oz020u/ca_inconsistencies_in_enforcement_of_policies/
AskHR,1oz00o5,2025-11-16T23:02:07+00:00,0,2,[AU] What can my previous employer divulge to my potential employer?,"Hello everyone,

I hope you've all had a fantastic weekend. I'm in some desperate need of advice please regarding what HR can divulge to potential employers.

I was previously an Assistant Store Manager at a retail store and was terminated prior to completing my six-month probation. The formal reason I was given by HR was ""failure to disclose a conflict of interest with your manager"" as I had engaged in an intimate relationship with a casual employee. However, I later learned through the casual employee some of the things she went to HR with which were borderline verbal and sexual harassment allegations. I was never made aware of this by HR or ever asked for my side of the story.

I am now to the final round of interviews with the Federal Government for an APS4 position and this job requires both a panel interview and a baseline security clearance.

**To what extent will the HR of my previous company divulge specific things the casual employee accused me of? Or are they more likely to stick to what they told me specifically which was a failure to disclose a conflict of interest?** I am worried if those allegations are on my HR record that it may impact my ability to secure future employment.

AskHR,1oyxh6c,2025-11-16T21:18:14+00:00,0,20,Supervisor requesting info and reporting “excessive FMLA use” HR won't fully respond to email. Is this allowed? [SC],"Hi everyone (sorry for this beast of a post), I need some clarity on a situation with my acting supervisor and HR. (BACKGROUND: The acting supervisor has been in this position for 2 and a half weeks, she is also the current Program Manager of my agency. My previous Supervisor had been dealing well with me and my health issues for almost 4 years)I have approved intermittent FMLA for a chronic medical condition. My certification allows variable usage each month. Since the approval in September, I’ve only used my FMLA twice in November.

The day of the 2nd occurrence of me using FMLA the acting sup texted me asking for my personal email as “HR was requesting updated FMLA paperwork.” This confused me because I had recently looked at my paperwork, as its nearing recertification, and had (again) only recently begun receiving it.

I responded to the text asking what they needed exactly, and she responded “HR will reach out tomorrow.”

This set off some alarms so I immediately contacted HR directly. They told me that she thought I was using too much FMLA, but when I asked what triggered that concern, HR just agreed that I was nowhere near my allowed usage, and basically refused to give me specifics. They said they would have “Human something something (I can’t recall the name)” speak to my sup about it, and I “shouldn’t have to hear anything back.” I was like ok but I would like to know what caused the issue so I can avoid it in the future. I got no response and we ended the call. I sent a follow up email (Photo attached, acknowledging what was said and done and asking out right what triggered the text, and everything that followed) but the attached response was all I received 😡

Here are the issues I’m unsure about:

Can a supervisor report “excessive use” when the employee is still within their medically approved limits?

Is a supervisor allowed to request updated paperwork based only on their personal opinion of “too much use”?

Should HR be required to explain what triggered the concern?

Is this considered interference or retaliation if the report is inaccurate or based on misunderstanding?

What steps can I take to protect myself going forward?

More Context: Acting Sup has made comments about my tardiness, even though its due to FMLA related illness. She also suggested I change my schedule to a later start time “because the next supervisor might not be as understanding,” which made me uncomfortable (again this is due to my illness and the protected status).

Acting Sup also has previously shown she does not like me, I have a history of her behavior almost all the way back to when we initially met. I have documented records, as this behavior and her status as my bosses BOSS was causing me added stress and my doctor asked me to document.

What should I expect HR to do here? And what else should I be documenting or asking for?Thank you again for taking my call earlier today. I wanted to follow up to ensure full clarity regarding my approved FMLA leave.

Today I received a text from my acting supervisor, ******, that HR was requesting updated paperwork for my FMLA. I asked what was required and she stated HR would reach out on tomorrow. Since I am currently in FMLA status, I reached out over the phone to HR for clarification.

When I spoke with HR it was stated that ****** thought I had “used too much FMLA,” which was surprising because, since receiving approval in September, I have only used my approved FMLA leave twice in the month of November and the 2 1/2 weeks with her as acting supervisor). As mentioned over the phone, my FMLA certification allows the attached amount of variable leave, each month, so my current usage is well within the approved limits.

For my records, could you please clarify:

-What specifically triggered the concern about excessive FMLA usage? A written explanation of what triggered the report that I had exceeded my approved FMLA usage. So that I can make sure I don't cause any issues by using the approved leave.

-Clarification on what, if anything, HR believes needs updating, including why updated paperwork was requested when my certification is current and my usage has been minimal.

I want to make sure everything is accurate and up to date on my end, and that there are no misunderstandings regarding my usage or eligibility.

Thank you so much for your time and for helping me ensure this is handled correctly. Please let me know if you need anything further from me.

Kind regards,

Neasha

AskHR,1oyvh2b,2025-11-16T19:59:16+00:00,6,18,[IL] Why Was My Reaction To Harassment Considered Worse Than The Bullying And Harassment Itself?,"So, Last month I started a new job at Jewel at the deli counter. I really liked the job because the customers were great and the work was pretty easy but my coworkers seemed to dislike me. If I needed to be trained they'd complain. If I messed up they'd complain and call me stupid. If I didn't know how to do something and one day they asked me to do it they'd be frustrated that I didn't know how to. They spent majority of the time complaining about the day, what they had to do and gossiping which sure.

The problem I had with them was they'd make comments about my weight. I do absolutely anything and I'd be called a fatass. I try coming into work and being kind to all of them and asking for help when I need it.

Last week I finally got tired of them and I came in and was assigned to do certain food items. While wrapping and putting pricing stickers on them I asked one of my coworkers who was closet to the bowls and pans if she could grab one of the pans that the food needed to go into. She started walking away without saying anything so I said it louder. She then said ""I don't have to do anything for you. I don't care if you did ask and I don't care if I was closer to it"". Ok, fine. She then comes back still resuming her complaints and repeating that she didn't need to do nothing and I decided to say that she needed to take her old ass home because all she was doing it as complaining and being disrespectful for nothing.

She then goes on a tirade about how I called her a name and getting loud going on and on about it then called over a mediator. The mediator condemned what I said but also her reaction when all she had to say was she couldn't because she was busy.

After that she then kept going and threatening to leave. Then threatening to punch me and saying that she could go toe to toe with me but she wasn't here for that but I got quiet after the mediator left and focused on my work. 
 
The week before that a guy who has been there for a while came in late and when he did I went on break. While I was on break he came to me telling me when I'm done to go do dishes. Ok, I said and as i was coming downstairs I heard him tell two of our coworkers about how my fatass was just up there playing on my phone and that I can do the dishes and that he didn't need my fatass over in their area because they got it.

I finished the dishes quickly and as soon as I got done customers started piling up. He then told me to come over and help the customers but I repeated the words he said. That he had it and didn't need me. He got frustrated but I didn't really care. I eventually went over to help the customers because the line was long.

On Monday, the same day I had the incident with the lady the same guy came in trying to order me around again and I just stood where I was helping customers. He said ""Hey, big man. I know you hear me. I need you to do the dishes. We got this over here."" I said ""Oh, I heard you but you're not my boss.""  He gets flustered and starts mumbling. Saying I should ask somebody about him. Saying he's gonna go find my boss. I decided to go write some reports on both of them because I have been getting harassed and bullied since I got there and I finally got tired of it. I ended up getting fired because of my comment. They completely ignored everything that led up to these things or the reason I finally decided to comment and the threats of physical violence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oyvh2b/il_why_was_my_reaction_to_harassment_considered/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oyvh2b/il_why_was_my_reaction_to_harassment_considered/
AskHR,1oyvf0f,2025-11-16T19:57:00+00:00,0,21,[IL] Laid off and offered 6 weeks severance but 12 month non-compete/solicitation. Do I have any leverage to negotiate?,"I was recently laid off in a workforce reduction and I’m trying to understand whether I have any leverage to negotiate a better severance package or reduced restrictions.

Facts:

-I was let go without cause.

-I worked for the company for 2 years.

-Company is roughly 3,500 employees, mostly manufacturing.

-About 10 people were laid off across Sales & Marketing, and based on salaries it appears to be roughly $1.5M/year in savings.

-Severance offered: 6 weeks of pay + benefits through Nov 30 + COBRA subsidy equivalent to 2 months of employer contribution.

-They are requiring a 12 month non-compete and non-solicitation covering my entire industry category. They specially name most if not all the companies that I could move to, and they prevent me from selling to any of my current accounts. 

-My work history is 11 years at the two largest companies in this category; all I have ever done is this line of work. 

- I consulted with an attorney and it doesn’t appear I have any legal claims, like discrimination. 

I don’t necessarily object to honoring the non-compete if I’m compensated appropriately for the time I’ll be prevented from working in my industry. I think I could land a role at a smaller competitor within 90–120 days, but in this economy who really knows. A 12 month restriction with only 6 weeks’ severance feels misaligned.

I’m also unsure whether it’s reasonable to ask them to either (1) drop or narrow the non-compete, or (2) increase the severance to fairly compensate me for the restriction. I also contributed strategic insights from my previous employer that my current employer has benefitted from, but I’m not sure whether that matters in this context (I resigned from the former employer and was not bound by a non-compete). 

I feel like I don’t have any leverage. Any guidance would be appreciated.

This was a teaching assistant job at my previous university. The contract renews every semester, and I actually worked there for four semesters (around 16 months). But for some reason, the report only shows the start date of my last contract which caused a full one-year discrepancy. (I also uploaded my W2s from both years as supporting documents when submitting the econsent form… but I guess no one cared.) They also put my title as “student worker” instead of “teaching assistant.”

I reached out to Sterling, but they told me they can’t update the report since it’s already been sent to the company, and only the employer can request a reinvestigation.

It’s been a few days and the company hasn’t contacted me for clarification or extra documents. I don’t think this role is critical to my current offer, but I’m still very very anxious.

I did end up getting a new job that will overlap with the WARN notice, but wanted to understand the risks first - a couple questions I’d love input for: 

1. Am I legally obligated in NYC or Federally to notify my old company of the new job so I can get pulled from payroll? 

2. Has anyone seen this backfire where someone was receiving double pay from the WARN notice and it affected their new job? or the old job found out at counter sued? 

I was thinking of just not updating my LinkedIn for a while until the payments end, but just didn’t want to take any risks with my new job since on paper i’m still “employed” at my old company for the 90 days just non-working. 

Any input or previous experience is appreciated!

AskHR,1oyduft,2025-11-16T05:49:05+00:00,0,6,[MD] ICE scare at warehouse,"On Friday we had an unexpected female visitor, in a trench coat, and somebody made an off handed comment that she might be ICE or the police. I went outside my warehouse to find out who she was and it turned out she is a sales person for a logistics company.

About 20 minutes later, I had four Hispanic employees in my office concerned that ICE is in our area and parking lot waiting for the Hispanic employees (assuming they are not legal even though they had the required I-9 docs). We have 80% Hispanic employees. I left my warehouse at 2pm and our 2nd shift Team Lead, who is Hispanic, took it upon herself to call our 2nd shift staff to tell them she saw ICE at 7/11 which turned out to be an armored truck. Out of 30 people we only had six show up and A LOT of work did not get done.

When I found out about this I did not know who told the staff to not come in so I sent an email asking who it was and telling them the person responsible would either be suspended or terminated as this entire situation could have been avoided if the person at fault would have spoken to me or the assistant manager. We could have easily cleared this up without disruption and chaos.

I received an email from the team lead saying it was her, she does not regret it, she would do it again, and she does not care if she is suspended or fired.

I’m looking for advice on how to proceed with this team lead. While appreciate that she is looking out for people I also know the situation should have never happened because ICE was not around and her lack of regret is concerning.

Any advice is appreciated.

I hold a critical position within a family owned business and have a lot of knowledge and understanding of our most crucial operations.  However, my boss has seen fit to turn over management to his youngest daughter who is only a few years out of high school and has no formal education or management experience.  She has made some very questionable decisions that have cost us customers, a lot of time and a lot of money.  I have brought up my concerns in a one on one meeting and was told directly that charge of those operations was still to remain with her.    
  
This week they apparently got into a heated argument late one evening in which he ""impulse fired"" her and told her to get out.  The next day, she was the one that came in at lunchtime to inform the company that she was fired and would be moving out of state.  Two days later, she messaged the whole crew again to simply say she was back with the company.  He never once addressed anything directly with anyone aside for a single text saying ""carry on with your day.""  I am not staying with a company where I am expected to play second fiddle to that.

AskHR,1oy7kil,2025-11-16T00:30:16+00:00,0,3,[CA] I know HR protects managers. But I am in PIP with a manager who has not given me much feedback prior to this during my first six months here. Would going to HR about a few things help delay the PIP? Would they even care to intercede?,"I work for a large tech company as a software engineer. I am less than a year into my job.

I had a non protected emergency happen during an important date causing me to miss a few hours and now I am on a PIP. Some of the concerns are valid but it may be a situation where things are being cobbled together to make the firing clean. It does not appear to be the kind of PIP I am designed to survive. Vague complaints to improve and no date to fix by. And frankly from what I have heard my company does not even do PIPs so I could get fired Monday a day after the PIP email. But I dont even know. Maybe my manager is just trying to scare me or punish me for this specific time I missed an important event due to an emergency. It's possible this is pushed by another teammate too.

It could also be he does not know another way to give feedback. He is flat out not a good manager. I thought I was far enough in my career where I did not need that but it's clear it's a problem. He never acknowledges what I achieve. We meet scarcely (maybe one a month). We have no meeting where our team strategizes, plans, architects. He actively lobbied against having testers/QAs for our product (I eventually won that argument). **I filled out my side of the mid year review, he never filled it out.**

I have felt incredibly unsupported.

Through this all you can't deny that he's accomplished. He's had a long and successful career. A of it though at a company that shelters ineffective leaders like no-ones' business. He's got talent to carry things on his own even.

I also don't have a skip here... which is very unfortunate. It's just 4 engineers here. We are in a corner of the company where we are cut off working on a small product. There is no engineering leadership above him. Only people who are very happy that he lead the creation of this app.

I know HRs priority is going to want to protect the company and my manager. I don't want to wage war against him. What I do want is help. And there are a few things I would hope they could maybe intercede on:

1. Calling him out on not submitting his side of the mid year review. Challenging whether he has given me feedback that can make me thrive in this new role.
2. Hearing my complaints when what he said in a meeting is different than the summary he sent afterwards.
3. Supporting me that I have improved in some areas. EX: he was worried about vacation time back in October 30th. That concern can't still be valid since I haven't taken vacation since.
4. Challenging why he and another long time coworker merge each others work in <10 minutes without any review. When I have a chance to review there are some times glaring issues.
5. Challenging that standards aren't applied unilaterally. He wants to claim unreliable work. We all make mistakes. I have fixed plenty of bugs that are avoidable with proper software engineering principles and architecture.

So I am really not sure. I do not have a lot of hope here. But does any of this sound like anything that HR would reasonably try and help with? Do they care at all about making sure managers are supportive?

AskHR,1oy0qsy,2025-11-15T19:36:29+00:00,0,3,[CA] Had terrible experience with accident insurance claim - is this normal? How do employees usually handle this?,"I broke my leg a few weeks ago and holy shit, filing the accident insurance claim through my employer's Aflac plan was way harder than I expected. I'm wondering if this is just how it works or if I'm doing something wrong.

Basically, I spent about three weeks tracking down medical records, trying to read through this 50-page policy document, filling out forms, and I finally got a check for $4,375. Sounds good, right? Except then I realized they underpaid me by around $700 because they just straight up missed several things I clearly submitted documentation for.

Then my chiropractor casually mentions that my plan covers PT and chiro visits at $50 each, which would be another $600+ that I had no idea about. And apparently there's also a wellness rider where I get $150 per person just for submitting proof that we went to annual checkups. I've been paying premiums for two years and never knew this existed.

I guess my questions are: do employees normally come to HR for help with this stuff, or is it just expected that you figure it out on your own with the insurance carrier? Because honestly, if I'm struggling with this and I actually have time to deal with it, I can't imagine regular employees who are juggling work and kids and everything else are successfully filing these claims.

Also, is underpayment just a normal thing I should expect? Should I be triple checking everything they pay me because they're going to miss stuff?

And for voluntary benefits like accident insurance, does HR typically do any education on what's actually covered? I feel like I paid for something I barely knew how to use.

I'm just trying to understand if this is par for the course or if there's a better way to handle this that I didn’t know about. Any insight would be helpful because I'm honestly pretty frustrated with the whole process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oy0qsy/ca_had_terrible_experience_with_accident/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oy0qsy/ca_had_terrible_experience_with_accident/
AskHR,1oxzsrx,2025-11-15T18:58:44+00:00,0,5,[CA] Paranoid over background check,"Hey all, recent graduate that signed their first job offer at a smaller commercial bank. Don’t want to celebrate yet as I still have to pass the background check, but I’m super anxious over a one-off credit card situation I had a year ago.

The background check is being done through Equifax and features a credit check. I have an “excellent” 774 equifax score and two credit cards that have had no missed payments or issues.

My only worry is a situation I dealt with an Amazon Chase card about a year ago. I originally paid the full card balance in the first month, but somehow incurred a $3 dollar charge that I was unaware about for about 2 months. I had no physical card and didn’t have access to the chase account so I had no clue I was missing a $3 dollar payment.

I eventually got a letter in the mail saying Chase had closed the account on my behalf and waived the remaining balance of $6 due to inactivity. My equifax credit report says the account is “ACCOUNT CLOSED AT CONSUMER’S REQUEST and CLOSED OR PAID ACCOUNT/ZERO BALANCE”.

I don’t see any mention of charge offs, collections, etc and the payment history just marks each of the 5 months as paid on time (no late payments). My only worry is that a month before they closed the card I see “Date of first Delinquency”.

This is the only blemish on my credit history for a stupid $3 dollar payment. Can’t stop freaking out over it.

AskHR,1oxvhdm,2025-11-15T16:08:27+00:00,0,30,[FL] ADA request still under review → Manager put me on a PIP. What are my options?,"I work as a senior-level engineer at a mid-sized tech company. About 2–3 months ago I submitted an ADA accommodation request related to a serious personal situation, backed by medical documentation and court records. HR acknowledged it was in review, but the HR person responsible went on maternity leave and the review never completed.

During that time:

I disclosed significant personal hardship (safety issues, housing instability, primary caregiver stress, etc.)

I continued working full-time despite extremely difficult circumstances

My assigned tasks were primarily validation work (testing + documentation), not implementation

A critical test tool we rely on was broken, making my assigned work difficult/impossible to fully “close”

I provided documentation, presentations, bug reports, and even a couple of fixes despite not being assigned implementation work

I had no documented performance issues previously

My manager is fairly new and I’ve only been under him for less than a year


Last week, out of nowhere, I was put on a 60-day PIP.

The reasons listed in the PIP include:

“Lack of commits” to a specific branch (even though I wasn’t assigned implementation tasks)

“Lack of ownership” despite completing all validation tasks and presenting findings

A comment that I was “too involved” in external stakeholder communications (which were actually company-approved and generated a large opportunity for the business)

A note that I should “succeed in my current role before taking on more,” even though I didn’t ask for more and was just supporting where needed

A vague professionalism comment based on a single Slack message, without coaching or context


What concerns me most is:

⚠️ The PIP was issued while my ADA request is still pending.

I even mentioned this in the PIP meeting, and it did not change course.

From what I’ve read, employers generally cannot move forward with disciplinary actions until the ADA interactive process is complete.

I’ve already emailed HR (professionally) acknowledging receipt of the PIP and expressing that I’m concerned about the timing given my ADA request is unresolved. I did not challenge the PIP directly — just asked for clarification on how they’re handling ADA + performance simultaneously.

I’m anxious because:

this came during the most difficult period of my life

my relationship with my manager is now completely broken

I no longer feel emotionally safe being evaluated by him

I worry this may be retaliation for disclosing hardship

I honestly don’t know whether this PIP is valid given the circumstances


My questions:

1. Is initiating a PIP before completing the ADA interactive process a violation or grounds to challenge the PIP?


2. What typically happens when an employee raises ADA timing concerns during a PIP?


3. Are companies expected to pause or re-evaluate disciplinary action once ADA concerns are flagged?


4. Should I request a manager reassignment due to the breakdown of trust?


5. How risky is my situation right now? What are the odds the PIP gets frozen/adjusted or thrown out?



I am not trying to attack my manager, I genuinely think he’s inexperienced and didn’t realize the process implications. But I’m scared, exhausted, and don’t want to lose my job while I’m supporting a young child alone.

Any advice from HR professionals would help a lot.

I am in a little bit of a predicament. I have my final interview in a couple days. I have had 5 interviews for a relations manager job.

When I checked their career website page I see that they have another job listed for Chief of Staff. (My previous role was chief of staff for another SaaS company similar to this one. The job roles and responsibilities are basically exactly what I was already doing and I think I am a good fit for the job that just popped up.

Since I am on the final round when should I bring it up that I am also interested in the other job. I do need a job so I don't want to blow the job I have a good feeling about. I don't want to seem wishy washy but the chief of staff is a much higher position with likely higher pay.

When I think about it I can either bring it up at the end of the interview when they ask if I have any other questions or, and I am leaning more towards this idea, finish the interview process for this job and if they send an offer letter for this job see if they would be open to seeing if I fit the the chief of staff role.

Hopefully this post finds some hiring managers as I would love to approach this correctly and in the right order. I am sold on the company and my approach would be I want to make sure I can drive the most value for the company with my experience and background. Any thoughts are highly appreciated.

Regardless of the role I get the person I am interviewing with would be my direct report as the VP of customer success so it wouldn’t change anything there

AskHR,1oxl5yk,2025-11-15T07:03:50+00:00,0,2,"[UK] Compounded problems at work leading to disciplinary, advice?","Hello, 

So recently I was handed a document that I was to have a disciplinary hearing at work, for alleged misconduct at work. I will briefly give a bit of a timeline and some details, it would be helpful for any advice on what I should do, if I should join a union etc etc.

  
So I am working as a creative producer at gallery and museum space, and for the first issue, recently I have been getting into disagreements with my manager. The museum had been pushing for more diverse opinions and ways of engagement, so I work developing and delivering programmes, workshops and other engagement sessions and at times my manager overseeing my project would suggest certain changes to make. I would defend my choices, giving the reasons why I think they would work and saying I disagree with her ideas, but if she would insist for me to do it her way I will. The issue seems to stems from my manager thinking I am being insubordinate and/or rude when I say I disagree with her, but will still do what she asks; even going as far as calling it passive aggressive, which when I responded that I am just being direct about what I am thinking, seeing that as rude.  

Of course after having these meetings with my manager where I feel we aren't able to communicate effectively, and I am just expected to not voice my opinion, or ask for clarity on why she believes her suggestion is an improvement (despite the fact that I am the one working on the ground in the galleries delivering them), I feel unhappy that my work is being dismissed or micromanaged. Me feeling unhappy has also been brought up as an issue about my conduct. Mediation was suggested that I agreed to and that was going to be the next step. 

However, now there is an additional issue. My role requires me to walk around and through the galleries, often many times a day, and I would on occasion stop and have a quick chat with the gallery support staff positioned in that gallery, asking them how the day has been, what the visitor footfall is like etc etc, which plenty of the office staff and security guards will often do. But one of the managers of the gallery staff team, who had taken a disliking to me due a falling out we had years prior, I believe has taken umbrage with me interacting with the gallery staff and started asking questions to the staff if I speak to them, using the most of weak of evidence (I can provide) to build a case claiming, excessive socialising, loitering and harassment on my part. 

Having received this as well as trying to put me through mediation with my manager, HR have decided that it is a sign of misconduct on my character and have decided to call me into a disciplinary hearing. I am unsure exactly what to do, what evidence to source etc etc.

I was terminated, but the reason for termination was in clear contradiction with the policies they cited. I was told it was attendance issues, that I had exceeded the number of call-outs it takes to get disciplinary action in a 12-month span, the most recent one being 2 weeks prior to termination. But I did prove that, per the attendance policy, the call-outs shouldn't have been counted for disciplinary action.

Trying to keep this brief, but TL;DR there are several other paragraphs in the attendance policy that were also contradicted. I've been outspoken to the company about it all trying to gain clarity, including requesting to see documentation that I'm entitled to see but they're being very careful about how they respond.

The inconsistencies lead me to believe that HR wanted me fired for discriminatory reasons so they forced my boss to retroactively count legitimate time off as strikes. I can guess what the discriminatory reasons are but there's no hard evidence that comes to mind.

I know MN is an at-will state but this company is nationwide and its been said that its ""extremely difficult for an employee to get fired"" because of how strictly the company follows their own policies. I don't really know what that's supposed to mean in corporate lingo. I just know they don't take advantage of their right to fire for no reason, and there's history of the company losing lawsuits for wrongful termination.

I don't even know what my question is I guess. I'm just not familiar with how big corporate works, this all just feels really icky. I also requested to see the PTO policy because they claimed my PTO hours wouldn't be paid out, and they gave me a version that was revised two days after I was terminated.

I went to prison when I was 19. I was released at 29. 
Since then, I have gotten married, had kids, went to college. I am now 49. 

In 2014 (9 years since being released), I applied for a manual labor job, accepted the role. It was then rescinded after the background check went back to 1993. 

A few months later, I passed a background check with another warehouse company. While working there, I finally earned my bachelor’s and moved into a role in their corporate office. I worked with that company for 7 years in total. 

I later was offered a supply chain role with another company. I accepted their offer, and sweated out the background check. I was notified I passed 2 days before my 2 week notice ended. 

I have moved to another company, also passing their background check. 

This week, I accepted an offer for a company in NY. 
I have read they are a 7-year look back state. But if the salary hits a certain threshold, they can go back further. 

My questions:

Do most companies do blanket 7 year checks on to ensure FCRA compliance? Or are they really running these salary specific? It’s not a VP+ role. I’m just hoping for a 7-10yr look back. 

Also, if the job is in NY and I’m in another state, what jurisdiction are they searching? My current home county?

My apologies for the long read. Any insights would be appreciated.

Do I escalate or back off?","I work for a company with a large corporate structure. We've been without an in-house HR manager since June, and all HR related responsibilities have been divided between functional managers. We have an interim HR Manager who works for us fully remote, from another facility a few hours away. 

I'm a controller (mix of accounting and operations). I assumed the responsibility of major employee conflicts. 

On three occasions this week, a new employee made comments related to race that were reported and handled by me. On all three occasions, I documented the incidents and had the employee sign the incident report. I tried to talk with this gentleman about why he can't paint with a broad brush, and why he shouldn't make comments related to race. My attempts to correct the behavior went in one ear and out the other. 

After the third incident, this employee insisted that it's impossible for him to discriminate racially because he, himself, is a black man. 

I have no idea what to do with his comment... Regardless of his response, I'm seeking to terminate him for cause. On three documented occasions, he offended others with remarks he made about their race. It should be as simple as that. 

Our interim HR disagrees and insists this is an incredibly neuanced issue that requires further investigation and corrective action, but never termination. 

I want to escalate this to the next level, but my fiance is telling me to take a step back. 

For reference, here are the comments:

Comment 1 Monday) The employee was walking behind two Hispanic women. ""There it is. They all walk slow as fuck."" When asked to clarify what he meant, he simply said ""Mexicans."" 

Comment 2 Wednesday) ""I don't care to figure out who's a Mexican and who isn't. They're the same thing. Beans and tacos.""

AskHR,1ox1w6j,2025-11-14T16:54:58+00:00,0,9,[CT] Navigating FMLA Leave,"Hello!

I’ve been dealing with a serious decline in my mental health due to a months long battle with my supervisors after the fall out of reporting an employee for theft of time and unsafe working conditions for our summer camp sites. This all culminating in receiving a write up for misconduct and I am preparing to to turn to legal channels to deal with workplace harassment and retaliation (as a union employee).

In mid October, I confirmed with our HR department that the forms on the website for FMLA were up to date (as they were dated from 2013) and was told yes. I was written up on Thursday and on Friday, I submitted for FMLA leave and provided the medical certification from my psychiatrist. 

The following Monday, I was made to fill out new forms because the forms I initially inquired about were now considered not up to date. I put the request in on Monday and submitted the certification on Wednesday. I had to request an eligibility letter and have yet to receive a determination letter. 

As of October 30th, I am on FMLA but have only received “provisional approval”. I am being told that per city policy, I must get a second opinion at the city’s cost. I asked the HR department if there’s reason to question the validity of my certification three times and they’ve ignored my question. As of 11/14, I’m still on provisional approval and the second opinion doctor is not available until 12/3. 

My questions are:

Does my HR department have to give me a determination letter within five business days?

Are they allowed to keep me on provisional approval?

And do they have to tell me the reason why they are questioning my medical certification?

I asked because HR was demanding I return my laptop before my leave even started and has blocked my city email access two days before my leave began, which also blocked me from seeing my timesheet. Once my PTO runs out, I trying to apply for short term disability and I can’t access my timesheets. 

Thank you!

AskHR,1owrx0r,2025-11-14T09:24:00+00:00,0,25,[IT] Offer received lower than the budget communicated,"Hi everyone,  
I’d like your opinion on something.

I got in touch with a recruiting firm that shortlisted me for a position. I had a first interview and shared my annual gross salary (95k), and they told me the budget for the role was 90k. Fine, I thought — I feel like changing jobs, and 5k isn’t going to make a huge difference.

We moved on to the second interview with the internal HR and the manager, remotely: everything went well, and they called me the next day for a third on-site interview (a date had already been set, but they were waiting for approval after the remote meeting).  
We did the in-person interview, it went really well, and they told me they’d get back to me within a week.

During the interview I said that I was willing to consider offers 5–10% lower (I’d get a company car, so that was fine for me).

The very next day they made me an offer by phone. They sent it in writing, and it was 65–70k plus a 10k bonus.  
I told them I was disappointed and refused the offer. They replied that they’d let me know if there would be a counter-offer.

Why tell me the 90k budget then? Considering that they called me back immediately and openly communicated the budget, I think they’ve boxed themselves in and have less bargaining power than they think.

Obviously they’re trying to get the most for the lowest price — but why mention the budget at all? Could it even be that the budget they gave me was lower than the real one? Could I push higher? Otherwise, the external recruiting agency really did a poor job.

I look forward to your thoughts on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1owrx0r/it_offer_received_lower_than_the_budget/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1owrx0r/it_offer_received_lower_than_the_budget/
AskHR,1owpniw,2025-11-14T06:58:01+00:00,0,13,Manager put me on a vague PIP right after I gained visibility. Stress triggered a gout flare. HR isn’t listening. What should I do? (Visa + short-term disability involved) [MA] [NY],"Hi everyone,

I (26 M) am in a very stressful and confusing situation at work. I work in a large construction company in a data-focused role, and I’d appreciate outside perspective.

Some background:

My first year was incredible. My previous manager was a respected, knowledgeable guy who taught me everything. Under him, I overachieved, got great reviews, and became the “go-to” technical problem solver on the team — the person others depended on when things were complex. I also began getting peer and outside recognition as well getting called to conferences and all that along with learning a lot of new skill sets which helped our team be more efficient.

Then a new manager took over.

He joined the team after I had already built trust with people and after I already had visibility with leadership. He was new to the kind of data/analytics work I do. At first he acted friendly — honestly, he’s known for being the “fake friendly” guy who tries to be buddies with everyone — cracking silly jokes in meetings , but the friendliness never felt real with me. I’m more of the quiet, serious, hardworking type who just focuses on getting things done and I’m also honest and respectful.

The moment I started getting more visibility with peers, directors and VPs for some of the work I did, his attitude towards me shifted a lot. He became distant, then critical.

He sent me “coaching notes” after 1:1s, but they were extremely vague (stuff like “improve alignment” or “show more proactiveness”). None of it was tied to actual performance failures, and none of it was presented as a warning or “you’re in trouble.”

Meanwhile:

* He encouraged other interns and a newer female teammate (who he seems to prefer a lot more) to learn the exact work I do even though he can’t teach it
* He downplayed my contributions
* He shows preferential treatment to other people in my team (Yes that female) and shows a blind eye to their shortcomings
* He stopped acknowledging my impact and is not involving me in important discussions
* He acted threatened whenever higher-ups liked my work and suddenly gives me feedback.

Now, completely out of nowhere, he’s pushing me onto a very vague PIP with no measurable goals. HR is siding with him fully, repeating phrases like “performance not aligned,” but they can’t point to any actual deliverable I failed.

When I asked for objective success metrics, they didn’t know what to say.

On top of all this — the stress caused a serious gout flare-up.

My gout got so bad I had difficulty walking, and my doctor had to give me a work note for limited mobility + WFH. My therapist said the stress is making the flare worse. I’m waiting for an updated note.

HR knows this and doesn’t seem concerned at all. He’s also currently doing this to another intern but they obviously are afraid to open u.

As someone on a visa — this is terrifying. As someone dealing with a medical condition that’s stress-triggered — it’s overwhelming.

My questions:

1. Is it normal for a manager to push someone onto a PIP right after they get visibility with upper leadership?
2. Have you seen PIPs used when a manager feels threatened or jealous?
3. Do people survive vague PIPs, or are they mostly exit tools?
4. Should I talk to an employment lawyer before sharing any evidence with HR?
5. If I go on doctor-recommended medical leave or short-term disability because of the gout flare + stress, does the PIP pause?
6. Is short-term disability something people actually use in situations like this?
7. Does this sound like retaliation or bias, or am I overthinking it?

I’ve worked extremely hard, stayed honest, stayed focused, and now I feel like I’m being punished for doing well.

I don’t know what to think.,"I recently started a lawyer intern and admin job. Everyone I work with has been great so far except for one coworker who has started acting strangely.

For the first couple of months, we barely spoke and everything was fine. One evening, before I finished for the day, I decided to wash all the dishes in the staff kitchen and leave the place clean. As I was finishing, she walked in and her whole expression changed straight away. She told me she likes doing the dishes and that I should leave them for her. I thought it was an odd thing to say, but I didn’t want to make it awkward, so I figured maybe it was part of her routine to wind down at the end of the day, or she was a germaphobe and liked the dishes washed a certain way?

The next week going forward, I left the dishes. I assumed doing the dishes (cups, plates and cutlery) would be a thing that everyone on the team would do. I asked a different coworker about this and she said she brings her own dishes and washes them herself, so she’s never used or washed the communal dishes. 

Then our boss sent a message in the group chat saying we needed to stop leaving dirty dishes at the end of the day. I felt this was aimed at me as I am an intern and do the odd coffee runs when asked. I explained what had happened and said that one of my colleagues told me to leave them because she liked doing them. My boss spoke to her and apparently she said I made it all up.

So I went back to doing the dishes every night.

A little while later, I was on a late shift with just her. She told me again that she wanted to do the dishes that night. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. When I left after her to lock up, I checked and the dishes were still sitting there.

I genuinely don’t know what she wants or why she keeps doing this. It feels like a trap but it also feels too silly to bring up again. Do I just ignore her and keep doing the kitchen cleanup, or should I say something to my boss so I don’t get blamed for dishes being left again?

AskHR,1ow4y5q,2025-11-13T16:04:11+00:00,0,13,[UK] Pregnancy & Sickness,"ADVICE PLEASE 🙏🏻 I started a new job on 15/9/25 with an NHS employer after working for an NHS trust for almost 2 years.

A couple of weeks before starting I found out I was pregnant. I told the new job about this as I started to become unwell. Following this as of 2/10/25 I have been off sick due to pregnancy related illness. I have had a couple of trips in the last week or so to the early pregnancy unit at the hospital due to concerns.

There have also been some major stressors in my life in the last 3/4 months- my grandma unexpectedly passed away the week before I started my new role, and unfortunately before I could tell her I was pregnant. As you can imagine, this is a huge toll to deal with emotionally. Along side the pregnancy issues I’ve been having, I’ve been feeling nothing but grief, regret, anxiety and depression and quite frankly feel robbed of an amazing experience of pregnancy.

Today I have spoken with occupational health after my management referred me. It came about that management had requested advice on whether they should encourage commencement of early maternity leave, should I not be fit to work- occupational health have said that this is not appropriate until at least 29 weeks gestation. I have no idea what to do now.

I am not fit for work. I am not mentally well enough either and I feel that this whole situation is only adding more stress. I have received minimal support, other than a phone call to ask if I’ll be back the following Monday or not.

Management quite frankly, and because I haven’t opened up to them, have no idea what’s been going on recently.

I’m at a loss. I’m not willing to start maternity leave early as this jeopardises my time after birth. I’m not fit for work, but as far as I’m aware I’m not receiving contractual sick pay, only SSP. My plan was to use my 2026 annual leave to go off early before my actual maternity leave would start in April 2026.

AskHR,1ovwty1,2025-11-13T09:35:17+00:00,0,11,[PA] Should I let HR know about issues with Supervisor?,"I'm debating to send HR the following email 
Hello Amy,
I apologized for the long email. I just wanted to follow up on our previous conversation when you asked about how things were going and the trouble I had with Jane. Things improved for a while like I mentioned to you. But recently she has been critical towards me.

For example, On November 6 Jane emailed me and Dee 8 o'clock at night saying Sara, have you responded to this Gsar? You have to respond to these 24 hours of receipt. It has been 24 hours.
She was referring to an email from a customer saying my response was accepted without reading the email and assumed it wasn't responded to. I emailed her back saying ""Yes, as the email states, This email is to notify you that this 8D has been accepted for CR/QR# Y90301. This means the 8D I submitted was accepted. I hope that makes sense. Have a goodnight."" 


On November 11 while doing Calibrations on platinum's at the end of the day Jane was short with me. I was writing down the temperature and ohms value in when it started to bounce all over. She said I need to speak up if it’s bouncing all over. But it wasn’t bouncing until I started writing down the temperature and ohms value. Mary told her that it was in when I started to write it down, but Jane didn’t apologize or acknowledge her mistake. 




Yesterday Jane asked me to check the resistance on some  parts and test them in the order they were in the holder. She said I didn’t need to place them back in the holder when I asked. I staged the parts to read them all at once but accidentally entered 15 instead of 23 in the computer. I gave her the results and parts and only realized my mistake when she asked why there were 15. I apologized and asked if she wanted me to reread them.  She said no because they weren’t in order and I should have done them right the first time. You're in Quality and details are important. Later, around 2:30 30 minutes before my shift ends Jane asked me to reread the parts. And wanted me to read them twice and place them back in order. I finished rereading them by shortly after 3:00. I left them on the stage because I didn't have time to individually place them all back on the holder. Then placed the test results on her desk, emailing her that they were done.


I believe I'm doing a good job. But its just starting to make it difficult to work while this is going on. I just wanted to let you know. 

I don't want it to look like I'm being difficult to work with yet at thr same time I can't work like this. I'm not saying she should ignore something if I made a mistake but its the way she's going about it and not acknowledging her mistakes when she makes one. 
Prior to all this I went to HR about Jane because she was evaluating me for a task I had only been shown twice on how to do. And I told her that. I was having difficulty finding something and the person that normally does this task started to comment where it could be found she wouldn't let him answer. This evaluation was done for 3 hours then she wanted to continue the evaluation the next day. This task only takes 15 minutes but will change because inspection it different on the various parts we received I was only shown twice a few weeks before hand. I never seen the parts I was currently inspecting before. She did this in front of people and made me feel stupid.

AskHR,1ovtp3o,2025-11-13T06:14:33+00:00,0,4,Is my boss trying to get me to resign? [SD],"I work for dependent adults- I have my whole career. I recently left a company of 5 years where I was a lead. Because I moved towns.

I’ve been working at this new company (same line of work) since June. My boss has been passive aggressive with me for months.

I always take my clients out, while my coworkers don’t. And I was vocal about this to my clients yesterday, as I’m on an 8-day work stretch and didn’t want to be taking them around town when my coworker can. I told them to ask my peers instead of always me. They took this as me and my coworker not liking each other. My boss sat me down today (she legit critiques me daily) but she said it was unprofessional etc. I expressed that I’m the one doing this daily and didn’t intend on making it sound like I hated my peers, because I don’t- I just wanted them to ask my peers to go on outings rather than me every single day. They told me my peers tell them no and they like me more. 

My boss kept implying I’m lazy basically- that I’m on my phone too much (which we’re allowed to do if clients are in their rooms) and I responded by telling her my peers do the exact same thing, and I’ve even caught them sleeping.

She said I wasn’t taking accountability and blaming them- I said, “you’ve sat me down dozens of times over the last few months and I’ve never thrown anyone under the bus, now I am just stating I’m doing what they are- and more work- but you’re not sitting them down.

She told me my coworkers don’t like me (which is false), she said she’s already talked to HR- and I told her I’d go to HR tomorrow and I’m leaving my shift today. I felt she was trying to get me to resign.

And she encouraged me to take a vacation, which I think is so she can develop a case to get me fired when I return. So I declined.

My coworker told me he was baffled- and this was so bizarre and he loves working with me- and he said he’s never had anything but good things to say about me. He was angry on my behalf.

My clients cling to me, they don’t cling to my peers. They ask me for everything. My boss said I basically have just been a fuck-up.

Should I even bother with HR or resign? How fucked am I? I’ve had a feeling for over a month my boss has been out to get me. She wrote me up weeks ago for missing a meeting, and my friend also missed it but he got no write up

And south Dakota is a “fire at will” state- so I can be fired for any reason, or no reason, as long as it isn’t discrimination. What do I do?

AskHR,1ovo0cd,2025-11-13T01:30:44+00:00,0,19,[WA] Audio recording in the work place and what constitutes consent.,"Hello!

I have never posted here before, so I will do my very best to follow the rules. 

I work in Washington State and upon being hired, was informed that yes, there are security cameras all over, but that they record video only, not audio. 

That being said, over the past few weeks, it has been implied or outright said, that in fact the cameras do record audio. 

I have reviewed our employee handbook,which includes a line that says: Employees should have no expectation of privacy in work related areas. 

My question is, does this mean that despite verbally saying they don't record audio, that they can in fact still do so? Also, the cameras are installed in the break areas as well, so would those areas still be considered 'work related areas'?

Also, is it, or would it be a reasonable expectation to say that it is not okay for security or management to then share that audio with individuals? For example, if a team lead had a personal friendship with the head of security and therefore regularly accessed security footage, despite the fact that their job pertains to something else entirely. 

I intend to speak to my own HR department about this, but would like to have a better understanding before that meeting. 

Appreciate any help/info. 

Thank you in advance. 


Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded. I seem to have gotten a few down votes that I don't really understand the reason for, as I've tried to be respectful and explain my intent, but oh well. 

I have more information than I did at the start of the evening which is really all I wanted so thank you again to everyone who gave their input.

I asked the company if I could be put on self checkout permanently because I was getting frequently dizzy and tachycardic on register from constantly bending over and lifting (I gave them a doctor's note from a cardiologist) They told me it wasn't possible, they said no one else has that kind of accommodation to just be on self checkout (not true), that self checkout required the same physical requirements because occasionally you might have to bend over or lift something (I haven't lifted something once in 2 years on self checkout), and it was too difficult for them to do and was part of my job description to do cashiering as well. Unofficially for about 2 years my scheduling manager honored my request with no issue (occasionally, maybe once every 6 months, he would have to schedule me for an hour or two on register to make it look okay on paper). Unfortunately he transferred stores. The only accommodation HR originally would offer me was calling a manager over every time there was a heavy item (basically every order) and it takes several minutes for a manager to come over. I think it was a tactic to get me to give up on accomodations because there's no realistic way for me to take that accomodation without a ton of discomfort and gripe from customers and alienation from other managers, because I would have to make customers wait several minutes because I can only flash my register light and hope a manager sees it (I cannot leave the register), and then the customers will get pissed off and lift it themselves, and it annoys the managers that don't want to come over every second to help. It also doesn't help the fact that I get winded from packing and lifting a ton of light objects at well. Do I have a case to get the accommodations I had for two years?

My coworker working under me (37F) reported to HR that I allegedly said ""Nameless isnt here today, the vibe is different. In a better way."" And noted on the email to HR that i said it with a serious demeaning tone. 

I was pulled into an office with the ""Nameless""(27F) person and a manager(40F) to discuss the situation presented on the email by the coworker(37F). The Nameless coworker was shaking and crying with emotion and frustration, meanwhile me completely oblivious and confused to the issue asked if there was something wrong. I was then told that Nameless was told that I said that about her.

To which I replied the truth, which was, ""The only thing I said was 'The vibe is different today' because she wasn't there. And i did not mean it in any way other than good. She is a very productive high-speed woman that gets things done fast and well. That morning ofcourse the vibe would be different if she isnt there. I didn't elaborate when i said that, because i had to answer a call as in the office we are suppose to answer call after call so there was no time to elaborate. By the time i finished the calls, I had forgotten completely about the small comment. No one brought it up again nor cared to ask about it. I didn't even think anything of it.

Now though I have addressed what have happened as such, they still count it as my first ever report made against me. As part of my 1/3 reports, which i find insane.

For reference, I am not from the East Coast and a lot of my manurisms or way of speaking and showing interest and respect is of hispanic desent and the locals way of showing those things are quite the opposite of how I was born and raised to be. I've been feeling discriminated towards to since the day I started. Making fun of how sometimes i may mispronounce a word, or getting called ""smart mouth"" for things i have ZERO ill intent for. I feel beaten down like as if everything i do is viewed under the microscope and twisted. Like a circle shape trying to fit into a star shape. 

Ive never reported anyone because everywhere ive worked at before, we have been ADULTS about any issues and just converse it out. Because 9/10 things are almost always a misunderstanding. 

Now, this being my first report ever filed against me and addressing the cultural differences, how much trouble am I in for this occurrence? 

No matter if i debunk it, they said they will count it as 1/3. And because its a ""she said that i said about that person"" report, is it even a valid report?

AskHR,1ovi723,2025-11-12T21:32:41+00:00,0,12,[VA] How should my wife handle a new manager who seems to be sabotaging her?,"Hi all,
My wife (32F) has been at her company for a few years and was always considered a top performer. She manages employee events and has consistently delivered successful results. Her previous manager, Archer, gave her glowing reviews and trusted her to operate independently.

A few months ago, a new manager came in (who also happens to be both Corporate Counsel and Head of HR). Since then, things have gone downhill. The new manager:
	•	Regularly berates my wife in team meetings
	•	Questions her decisions on event planning, often undermining her in front of others
	•	Withholds information until the last minute, creating unnecessary stress with vendors
	•	Allows her assistant to micromanage and interfere with every detail, from invoices to logistics

The assistant frequently makes passive-aggressive comments like, “You should be leading this event since it’s your event,” but only steps in to “help” once things are already running smoothly.

When I first met this manager at an event, her very first comment was negative….even though she and her assistant had altered the original plan and caused most of the issues. Within a few weeks, 7 out of 10 people in the department were terminated, and my wife was made to clean out their desks while the manager “worked from home.”

Since then, my wife’s been anxious, especially because her manager refuses to schedule one-on-one meetings but still makes comments about her “performance.” It really seems like they’re trying to push her out or create a paper trail for termination.

She’s torn.. she doesn’t want to quit and give them what they might want, but it’s becoming emotionally draining.

Questions:
	1.	What’s the best way to protect herself professionally here? (e.g., documentation, HR report, legal counsel?)
	2.	How does someone handle this when the manager herself is also HR and legal counsel?
	3.	Should she quietly start looking for another role in the meantime?

This year the NY office hired an HR representative that is now his boss, and she is significantly more professional than he is, but somewhat reluctant to get involved with incidents at our office as that is supposed to be his job. The thing is, he is a gossip that is only concerned about being cool with the people he considers his friends, but he even gossips about them. I'm talking both their personal life and any complaints from/about them.   The impression I get is he believes that when people come to him with complaints, it is to gossip and not because he is HR and should be the one to do something about it. So many people have told me they do not report verbal abuse fro management because HR will not do anything about it but make it worse (example telling the manager who said what and hiding it from the upper management.) I once was in his office for a work related question and he received an incident report which he proceeded to show me and talk ish about both people involved. He's also talked to me about how much certain people get paid, along with people taking leave and for what reasons, completely unprovoked. I've also made a complaint to him about verbal abuse from upper management, and later that year a coworker from a different department told me they heard about it. Upper management is aware and even engages in this behavior with him - there was once a report of sexual harassment made against one of HR's friends and he and the COO said a write ur that person would be unnecessary. Keep in mind this same HR manager also once threw a mug of coffee at the controller, the owner was aware, no write up, suspension, no consequences. Someone had reported to the NY HR that our HR manager talks about people's wages, and he was angry, but literally said ""They can't prove it."" I guess my question is - I understand some of this is surely illegal, but I have no concrete proof and upper management doesn't seem to care at all. What should I do?

I’m struggling with whether that qualifies as being unable to work. My job requires a lot of accuracy and sustained focus, and I don’t want to risk mistakes or delay healing by returning too soon.

For context, my parents will be taking care of me during recovery, and since this all falls around the holidays, that will involve being out of town with them for about 10 days, which would bring my total recovery time to roughly three weeks. It’s not a vacation since I won’t be able to participate in any activities, but I’ll be resting and letting them help me since I live alone and don't have anyone else who can help me during this time. I’m just unsure how that might look from an HR or insurance standpoint while on short term disability.

I’ve only accrued three days of PTO since starting this job a few months ago, and I can’t afford to take three weeks completely unpaid, which is why I’m trying to figure out whether short term disability is the appropriate route. My physical therapist recommended taking 2 to 3 weeks off if possible since my work is mentally demanding.

Has anyone seen situations like this before? Would my doctor need to phrase anything in a specific way for disability approval? And from an HR standpoint, do I need to disclose that I’ll be out of town recovering with my parents?

I just want to make sure I’m handling this ethically and transparently. I’ve been a bit stressed trying to figure it all out, especially since working remotely on pain meds would be tough.

AskHR,1ov65lw,2025-11-12T14:10:55+00:00,9,9,No Communication after what feels like a reprimand [NJ],"Sorry for the length of the post, I’d like advice on how to handle. Not really sure how to handle any of this. While my position is labeled hybrid, we are remote and communication beyond a yes or a no, is rare, I have physically met my bosses 4 times, never spoken on the phone or even had a zoom meeting to discuss cases. It’s wild and something I’ve never experienced in 20 years as a paralegal. 

I’m a defense litigation paralegal, we bill for 95% of all we do. 2 years ago, I joined a firm and was given the sole responsibility for one clients matters. It was at minimum a 2 person job, but the client would only approve 1 paralegal.   In January/February, with no communication to us, the attorney had two of us working on files. We were called into HR, advised that there would be no bonus on February’s work as the client did not pay due to 2 paralegal’s. I was caught off guard, but continued trudging. 

In May through July, there was an issue with a co worker harassing myself and two of the partners due to mental health issues, the resolution was to block him from all our phones and place him with another attorney to avoid contact. No communication with me about whether I was ok or not, or to advise that the situation was handled. At that point I started applying for jobs elsewhere. 

Last Wednesday I was again called into HR, the client cut my billing again because their systems changed and where they previously wanted things broken piece meal, they now wanted “bulk” billing. Again, no bonus for October.  Never told of this “change” until this moment. 

I have went gung ho applying for new positions. I applied  to a “confidential” law firm posting Thursday or Friday. That was “declined” Sunday late afternoon, cand with an email signed from “current firms name”. 

Monday I come into an email from attorney, timestamped 2 minutes after the decline email, that I was being taken off that clients work as it wasn’t sustainable for the firm to have time cut. Not given time or advice on how to restructure within the clients newest parameters.  

I responded to the attorney and paralegal boss, 9am Monday, stating:
 “thank you for letting me know, I really enjoyed working with a, b, c (clients names) and please let me know where I can continue to be an asset to the team”

 (I have a second bosses work, so it’s not like I have no work). 

Then I get out of that email and see an email received not two minutes after the “taking you off” email, Sunday night,  with commendation for finding information in prior records that likely saved the client $10-20k and she would handle it as I was now off the client. 

I have received zero response from any higher ups, but also the client keeps sending emails and I can’t reply. Like no response at all. 

What do I do? If I did something wrong shouldn’t we have a plan to rectify it? Why am I being penalized for something I was never advised of? Why can someone harass and basically get their way?

I am presently on FMLA for my own medical condition with job protection for 12 weeks. As that time draws closer, it has become evident to my doctor that I will not be medically cleared to return to work within that time frame. Unfortunately, there is no clearly defined date for when I will be recovered at this point. 

What will likely happen when I tell HR that I am not cleared to return at the 12 week mark? 

I imagine that they will not hold my job indefinitely, (especially without an estimated recovery date). Are they likely to terminate me immediately? 

Lastly, how does unemployment work in the case of this type of termination? Would I be able to apply after I have recovered even if it is several months after termination? (Hopefully I will find another job by then so it won’t be an issue, but just in case).

AskHR,1ov0twk,2025-11-12T09:36:04+00:00,4,3,Should I resign or wait if management asks me to leave but HR hasn’t contacted me? [PK],"Hi everyone,

I’m in a tricky situation at work and would really appreciate your perspective. I want to share the full story so you understand the context.

About 11 days ago, my manager (and regional head, two levels above me) asked me to resign due to performance issues. This was verbally communicated over calls. The manager even CC’d COO, HR, and other senior management in an email about my performance. In that email, they mentioned my monthly targets versus achievements, highlighting that my performance “has not met expectations” and said the management decided to “part ways.”

Since then:

* My access to company apps and systems has been restricted.
* I haven’t been working at all and have not approached anyone in management or HR.
* Only the KHI managers have been in touch; HR has not contacted me.
* I am keeping all company assets intact.

I have not submitted a resignation yet. I’m trying to stall for time because I want to:

1. Ensure I have **documentation of everything**.
2. Control my **professional narrative** — I’d prefer to show that I resigned upon management instruction, rather than being terminated.
3. Protect my right to an **experience letter/service certificate**.

I know that legally, in Pakistan, managers can ask an employee to resign, and the proper process requires HR involvement to formalize it. So I’ve been considering waiting until HR sends a written communication before taking any steps.

My question to the community:

* Should I wait for HR to contact me officially, even though my manager already asked me to resign?
* Or would it be better for my professional reputation to submit a resignation now, clearly stating it was per management instruction?
* How would you handle this if your access is restricted and HR hasn’t reached out?

I’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve faced something similar. I want to make sure I handle this professionally and legally, without hurting my future job prospects.

AskHR,1ouzuoi,2025-11-12T08:32:41+00:00,0,28,On intermittent FAMLI leave (postpartum)and have been calling out one day a week during work weeks on average- can job fire me without due process? [CO],"I’m about 3.5 months postpartum and transferred departments during my initial leave period. I’m now on intermittent leave, working other week.

The new position I’m in is primarily physical labor, and although I was told I’d be given mainly “light duty” and admin tasks, this hasn’t been the case. I’m also scheduled to work a morning shift immediately following a night shift in which I clean all night; although this is technically legal, it seems cruel to me. When asked if I could change this around I was told I’d have to have a coworker agree to permanently switch shifts with me.

I ended up calling out due to being too sore one day on one week, then for mastitis the next (due to not pumping often enough paired with physical exhaustion), then for getting no sleep between a night and morning shift the next, then due to a family emergency the next. Except for this most recent time, the call outs were largely due to physical pain and exhaustion resulting from the work tasks.

My immediate supervisors told me they’ve “noticed a pattern” with my calling out and it’s made me worried I’m going to be terminated. I am technically an at-will employee, but I do work for a state government agency and am part of the union, so I’m not sure if they can legally fire me without any sort of prior verbal or written warning. I was also told by my department head (boss’s boss) I would initially be scheduled in a way to where it would minimally impact the department if I couldn’t come in (ie with relative flexibility).

How can I protect myself in this situation? Should I preemptively talk to HR or “skip the ranks” and go to my department head (who is a woman, with all the other managers being men)? I’m honestly considering resigning anyways but want to avoid being “terminated”.

They never specified the length she would have to continue her employment.

She asked her HR about that and HR didn't seem too happy that she was asking that. So about an hour later she informed her that she's actually not going to be eligible for the paid time off because she hasn't reached the 1 year mark. She's been there 10 months. I understand it's policy but HR has been telling her she is eligible for months and even had her sign and file the paperwork for it so it kind of sounds like they were totally fine with it but threw that policy at her after she asked because they thought she was trying to leave, which isn't the case. She was planning on continuing her employment. It also sounds like they're basically going to let her go after she burns up her PTO. Also, since she is under 12 months she can't even do unpaid FMLA leave and keep her insurance. Just trying to see if anyone has some advice or had anything similar happen? We are in Illinois.

AskHR,1ouv9xy,2025-11-12T04:07:05+00:00,0,10,[CA] Manager Scheduled a Meeting With HR,"Sorry in advance; long story ! 
About a month ago HR requested a meeting with me because my name came up in their investigation into  complaints from previous employees about one of my managers. I explained to HR some of my concerns, and how I didn’t file a complaint myself because I was trying to give my manager the benefit of the doubt. HR pushed about the concerns, so I informed them of my manager making me feel uncomfortable once when she told me I couldn’t wear shorts to work, even though others do the same, because “sometimes things look different on different people’s bodies.” When I had a change in schedule that drastically reduced my hours (due to a client’s change), I was advised to ask this manager to be added as an assistant for our workplace to make up for those missing hours. She was actively trying to find someone to fill those hours, but when I volunteered she said that “there is currently no need for an assistant” and I can “work on finding shifts to cover” instead. A few days later I received a message from her stating that she has added the assistant time to my schedule moving forward. The receptionist at my work stated that she recommended me to the manager for the assistant position, and that the manager didn’t want me in that position, but the receptionist “vouched for me”. After starting the assistant position,t manager put in place a new “policy” that we were to document when we arrived to cover a coworkers bathroom breaks, and when they returned, essentially “timing” how long people were spending in the restroom. Additionally, I mentioned that multiple coworkers discuss how she seems to pick and choose favorites and targets certain employees for dress code violations, attendance, and giving clinical direction (when it is not her area of concern), but does not do so equally across the board. Basically, she seems to creating a hostile work environment due to these situations. 

After that HR meeting, I was in contact with our region’s HR rep regarding attendance policies, as there were multiple conflicting policies between what is posted in our break room, in our handbook, and what that manager was telling me. October was a bad month for me attendance wise, due to me getting the flu and being told to stay out of work with a physician note, my son having medical appointments for Autism testing, and for a concussion I received at work. According to my attendance tracker dashboard, I was .87 hours over my allotted “unexcused” absences, because they would not accept the notes from my son’s doctors for his Autism testing (HR said it was confidentiality issue?). 

Anyways; I took 1 day off this month, utilizing our company’s time off policy for “school activities” for parents with children 18 and under. On top of that, I have over 13 hours of make-up hours converted due to me picking up extra shifts and covering for other people. I checked my attendance tracker last week and was shown to have “1 unexcused absence”, which could only have been for the day I took off to attend my son’s school activities (for which I found coverage, with 3 days notice). Our company’s policy is an absence is excused if it is “PTO, school activities for parents policy, more than 8 hours notice, and full coverage is found”. I reached out to my manager asking why it was listed as unexcused, for which she stated she would look into the matter and get back to me “end of day tomorrow”. She never got back to me, but my attendance tracker was changed to show the absence as excused, and I just assumed it was an oversight. 

Fast forward to today, I received an email invite for a meeting with my manager and the HR rep for our region that I had been in contact with. The meeting is scheduled for Thursday (2 days from now). There was no other information other than the meeting titled “Check In”. I sent a group chat to the HR rep and the manager asking if this was a meeting request, and if I could inquire what the meeting was for. My manager messages back saying “I was just sending you a message, thank you for reaching out, yes we will be discussing your questions on dash board and reviewing a recent concern that was previously discussed with HR.” I assume the concern we will be addressing is my complaints about my manager, but I am waiting for the HR rep to get back to me, as I asked her if she could clarify what concerns we will be discussing. 

So I guess my questions are as follows; 

1) Am I required to attend a meeting about complaints lodged towards my manager, if she is also in the meeting? - I understand everyone should have the right to face their accuser, but this feels like a she-said she-said case. Which is exactly why I didn’t want to talk to HR in the first place. If I was comfortable discussing this WITH my manager, I would have done so in the first place. 

2) What are my rights, should this turn into some sort of disciplinary meeting? As stated before, this manager has shown to be very retaliatory, and I am worried she will try to bring in my attendance from last month to excuse her actions. 

3) Has anyone been in a similar situation, or have any advice on how to navigate this ? I’ve read tons of posts about people being fired for complaining against their manager to HR, and really can’t afford to lose my job. I’m stressed out.

AskHR,1oulw8k,2025-11-11T21:19:59+00:00,0,11,[UK] (England) Manager accessed an old personal on work onedrive - feels like an overstep,"I recently discovered something that’s left me feeling quite uncomfortable, and I’d like some perspective on whether I’m overreacting or if this is genuinely inappropriate.       

I work for a small UK organisation. My manager (who’s also the office manager) has delegated access to my Outlook and OneDrive for continuity reasons. I understand that means she can access work-related documents if needed.       

However, I’ve just found that a very old personal file (a cover letter from a job application nearly two years ago) was shared from my account with her. I didn’t share it myself, and I wasn’t even signed in at the time. The file is clearly unrelated to my current job and had just been sitting in my OneDrive without me realising.        

It now looks like she accessed my OneDrive and shared that file to herself. It’s not confidential or damaging, but it feels like an invasion of privacy and definitely outside the purpose of delegated access. I can see she logged in through the sign in history - the file was private to my work account but I recognise that doesn’t bar them from viewing it).           

I’m not sure how to handle this. On one hand, I don’t want to cause drama by accusing her of snooping.

I am seeking perspective from others as I prepare to negotiate and accept a role with less responsibility following a c-suite position.

After being passed over in the final round for half a dozen other c-suite roles, I have just received a prized offer letter for a director-level position in a growing national company. The opportunity will allow me to lead a multi-site team, own a decent budget, and importantly, get back to leading impactful comms campaigns. I’m excited- not only to finally have an offer in hand, but the team checks all my boxes!

I’m currently serving as CMO in a small private company. It’s kind of a nightmare: I don’t have a dedicated team (we have matrixed/dotted lines for staff) and have very limited budget to do good PR/Marketing. Worst of all, my CEO doesn’t value my function as a strategic business driver, so my work isn’t valued and I just feel stagnant. The new role reports to the CMO at the new company, so I’m looking forward to having someone to learn from and possibly be mentored.

My current exec team is chaotic and dysfunctional at best, so I’m confident that the new job will be better for my mental health. However, there’s a considerable salary gap. We were all aware of the gap in salary expectations going into the process, but they offered me 10k over their posted range to start as a show of good faith and saying that’s the absolute ceiling they can offer for comp. No bonuses are offered at this level. Thinking I’ll try negotiating PTO and maybe a professional development budget to try and get me closer to the $40k I’ll be forfeiting. For HR people: I’d love to hear what other creative ideas have worked for salary negations with large salary discrepancies in this hiring market.

Finally, I’m coming to terms with this being a step back in my career. I have steady job that pays me well, but I’m miserable. I have worked so hard to make it to the boardroom and feel stupid for taking a lower level, lower paying job in this economy for the *potential* for a better work environment. I know a job isn’t forever. And this company will have a career path if I want to stay for several years, but it would require a few people above me to roll off/up. I also worry about the optics of the step back if l decide to go for future executive jobs outside the company. After making it to the final round so many times and being second choice, I can see that I was clearly missing some layer of executive presence or experience, so I’m worried this lower rank puts me at a further disadvantage.

I’ve tried asking about a VP-level title, but they’ve just promoted the marketing director into a “strategic VP position” and it sounds like she had to strong arm them into giving her the role. I could ask to take on her team and lead both comms and marketing? 

Anyway I would love advice from others that have downsized their role and salary for mental health reset. How did that change play out for you? Was it hard to regain that executive position later?

Well the new HR coordinator said that she cannot tell me how many hours I have remaining due to my FMLA being ""as needed and shouldn't be planned"". I have told her I'm not planning time off. I'm simply trying to verify my spreadsheet to theirs.

Firstly I’ve had a really awful weekend and ended up asking to work from home yesterday as I didn’t feel capable of coming into work (CPTSD and experiencing depression at the minute also). Today when I arrived back to work he asked me with quite a judgemental tone why I felt as though I couldn’t come into work yesterday, and continued to berate me for leaving him on site alone - we are technical staff working on a research site and isolated from the rest of the institution. I am by the way an apprentice and he is the site manager, and last week he booked a day off work leaving me on site alone. We usually have a third member of staff to prevent line working but he’s been on extended sick leave. He also went on to say that I can’t do my job from home, which I absolutely can as I had my laptop, most of the job is admin and I’ve done it before many times.

The other thing - there’s been a person attending the site over the last few weeks who has become increasingly intense with me to the point that I feel I’m being harassed, and on one occasion I was incredibly uncomfortable. I talked to my boss about this and asked him to not put her on jobs with me (something that would be very easy for him to do) as I didn’t want to be around her as I felt she was harassing me. He then went on to say that he hoped I hadn’t scared her away from coming to the site, spent a single week putting her on different jobs to me and then last week had her work with me for a whole afternoon.

I feel incredibly judged, ignored, all that jazz. I’m actually leaving this job in 3 weeks partly because I can’t stand to work under this boss anymore, and I don’t want to cause a massive fuss before I leave, but I don’t think I can just let this stuff go, it’s completely unacceptable.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do? We’re quite a massive institution so there’s people I can talk to higher up, I just spend all day every day alone with my boss which makes things a bit awkward. Maybe I should just lay all of this out in an exit interview? I feel like I should say something to him now but I’m really not very good at voicing my opinions when they will cause conflict.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ou5hqa/uk_poor_treatment_of_mental_health_in_the/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ou5hqa/uk_poor_treatment_of_mental_health_in_the/

AskHR,1oty29l,2025-11-11T02:46:25+00:00,14,19,"Workplace bullying ignored for years. I resigned, now HR is involved.  [AU]","Hi everyone, I really need some advice because I’m exhausted and unsure what the healthiest next step is.

I’m 26F and I’ve been working in my current role for a few months. One of my coworkers (50M) has been extremely aggressive since the day I started. He’s been with the company for around 5 years and has always behaved this way. He yells, swears, slams things, and speaks to people in a hostile, demeaning tone. Everyone just accepts it because “that’s just how he is. That is his personality”

He does this to everyone, including customers.

It’s like working with an abusive parent. Everyone is constantly walking on eggshells, worried about what mood he’ll be in, what he’ll yell about next, and whether today is going to be the day he blows up again.

In my first week, he yelled directly in my face. He threw a pen at my head to “get my attention.” He makes comments about me loudly to other people, and yells at the Workshop Controller and technicians the same way. This is daily, not occasional.

This behaviour is not “rough communication.” It is **consistent verbal abuse and intimidation.**  
Examples:

* Yelling and swearing at myself and others daily
* Slamming objects and using aggressive body language
* Speaking to staff in a demeaning, hostile tone
* Undermining people publicly
* Throwing a pen at my head to “get my attention”
* Yelling directly in my face in my first week
* Making comments about me to other coworkers rather than speaking to me directly

This behaviour is directed at **everyone**, including customers. 

I had time off recently because my dad passed away, and while I was away, he made comments like:

“She’s holidaying down there while we’re working.”

That one really stung, and honestly, it was the point where I started to emotionally check out.

I raised his behaviour **multiple times** with both my previous manager and current manager since I started, and I was basically told:

**“That’s just who he is, that’s his personality”**

So nothing changed. Not only that, multiple other staff have been complaining about this co workers for YEARS. 

On Thursday after I finally said I couldn’t keep working in this environment, he was spoken to by management. When I came in Friday Morning, he was crying and tried to apologize, but immediately shifted into hostility again, saying:

**“Well it’s obviously f\*\*\*ing not all good since people are complaining about me. And continued to mumble negative comments under his breath.”**

At that point, I resigned on the spot.

And suddenly everyone took it seriously.

HR has now been brought in. Only after i RESIGNED. 

# Before the HR meeting

When I came into work yesterday morning, he suddenly tried to act “extra nice” to me. I later found out he had spent Friday loudly saying:

>

Meanwhile, his wife (who also works there, along with his stepson) refused to speak to me and gave me death stares. I could hear her whispering about me to him and others.

It was very clear that **retaliation** had already started.

I asked my manager what time the HR meeting was, and he said:

“Are you sure you want to go through with this”

I said:

“Yep definitely. And I want you there”

# The HR Meeting

I had prepared a **five-page document** outlining incidents, dates, comments, and witnesses. I handed it directly to HR.

HR took it seriously
There was **no minimising** and no excuses.

They acknowledged:

* The **psychological impact** on me
* That this behaviour is **not normal or acceptable**
* And that this was the **first time HR had ever been informed** (because previous management never reported anything, despite me raising it multiple times)

They asked me **not to resign**, and they **begged me to stay** while they conduct a full investigation.

They gave me the rest of the day **fully paid** and told me I do **not** have to return to the workplace during the investigation.

They have already spoken to other staff, and multiple people have confirmed that his behaviour has been happening for years.

HR also acknowledged that his wife and stepson working in the same department is likely against policy, and they now understand how that contributes to an unsafe dynamic and makes retaliation more likely.

# The key question HR asked:

“If he remained employed, could I see myself returning”

I was honest:

“I said I cannot answer that” 

Because historically, this coworker is *“nice” for a few days*, then goes straight back to the same aggressive behaviour.

I don’t feel emotionally safe returning only to wait for the next blow-up.

  
**My Questions:**

1. Has anyone gone through HR for workplace bullying and actually seen **real, permanent change?**
2. What should I expect from here with the investigation?
3. How do I protect myself from **retaliation**, especially since his family works there?
4. Should I continue documenting everything? (I am.)
5. Realistically — **is returning even a good idea**, or is leaving the healthier and safer option?

Thank you

I am at the end of my internship. Now, after some examination, I found that there is a performance report on the dashboard in the web version of the app, Apploye. Maybe, the app records keystrokes and mouse movement to create this report.

AskHR,1otvsxc,2025-11-11T01:02:08+00:00,0,5,[CA] Provider said they would fill out FMLA paperwork and haven’t submitted it. Advice needed.,"
I took leave due to serious mental health reasons on September 22nd. This was discussed with my therapist and psychiatrist weeks prior to making this decision and they advised they would fill out the paperwork for me.

I submitted the paperwork to my therapists office per their guidelines as soon as it was received, and over a month later it has still not been submitted. I have followed up with my therapist and the her office well over 20 times. I made sure to send written follow ups via email for a paper trail in addition to phone calls. I have been told “it takes a few days” and “there was a problem completing the paperwork” and “it’s been completed but takes up to five business days to submit after it’s been finished.” Literally excuse after excuse.

My paperwork deadline came and went on October 23. I was issued a formal denial from MetLife on that day. The person at MetLife was understanding and even admitted she has worked with this office before and they have been notoriously slow.

My therapist office sent me an email today that they have escalated the issue and it will be submitted tomorrow.” I find that hard to believe at this point. My therapist has also said not to worry because they will reopen and approve once it’s completed.

I also received an email from my company asking me why my documentation wasn’t submitted and that I will likely be liable for paying back any benefits to the company. When I told my therapist this she responded “good thing you have savings!” This made me see red.

I am infuriated and this has absolutely made me spiral worse than when I took leave. I wish I just quit instead, especially now that I’m going to obliterate my entire life savings. I’m now concerned that I will get fired and lose my entire livelihood when I could have gotten by a few months if I had just resigned.

I haven’t received a dollar amount of what I will owe my employer at this point, but my question is: are there any legal protections here? Should I be reaching out to a lawyer for representation since I have all conversations documented? I do not want to pay my employer back a single cent and feel like my therapy office should take accountability for how royally they have screwed me. I am also considering filing a formal complaint with the state against my therapist and her office.

AskHR,1otvf1y,2025-11-11T00:45:04+00:00,0,1,[CA] How to tell my manager I want to move to another internal team (without burning bridges)?,"Hi everyone,

I work at a large organization and have been part of **Team A** for about two years. When I joined, we were busy with exciting projects and clear goals. But now, most of that work is done, and our roadmap looks pretty light. These days, we mainly act as consultants to **Team B** (same org, just a different group).

Team B, on the other hand, has a strong pipeline of projects, better structure, and clear direction. They’re also hiring internally, and I’m planning to apply since the kind of work they’re doing aligns better with my interests.

If things were stable, I honestly wouldn’t mind staying with Team A and enjoying the slower pace. But with the current uncertainty and occasional layoff rumors, I’d rather move to a team that’s clearly growing and in demand.

Here’s my concern:

* I know I should **inform my current manager** before applying.
* But there’s a bit of **competition** between our teams, so it could be awkward.
* My manager might ask, “We work closely with them already, why do you want to move?”
* If I don’t get selected, I don’t want it to hurt my standing in the current team.

I’ve been with this team for over two years and have no issues with anyone. I just want to make a thoughtful, career-safe move within the company.

For those who’ve done this before:

* How do you bring this up to your manager tactfully?
* What phrasing or approach helps keep it positive?
* Any red flags to avoid when discussing an internal transfer?

AskHR,1otuplk,2025-11-11T00:14:03+00:00,0,3,[IL] How to make sure my husband won’t have more issues at his job,"Okay so my husband got a job in December 2024 then got fired in March 2025 basically because he misunderstood his supervisors directions and ordered a new company card when the original one was in her locker, it was a misunderstanding but she got in trouble with it with her supervisor.

We were super stressed out after this, as we literally lost our and our children’s insurance benefits, but we luckily had a good amount of savings to fall back on so it was not like we were really financially struggling thankfully.

Now he got a new job in June at an immigration law firm in Chicago, fairly close to us which is convenient. Essentially, the issue started at a company dinner. One of his coworkers (female) had a few glasses of wine and touched his arm and made a very flirty comment about how he must work out a lot and she’s so glad he’s working with her. She also knew he’s married. He was uncomfortable and said “that’s really nice but I’m married”. I am friends with a woman at his office and she told the same story as she was there. As much as I trust my husband wholeheartedly, it was nice to hear.

Now the next day, he wanted to set a clear boundary with the woman who flirted with him. He said to her “hey you are a super cool person but I just wanted to let you know I am married, so please keep that in mind”. When she responded to what he said, she got super embarrassed and just kind of blushed and was quiet.

The next day, he got pulled into a meeting with his supervisors saying they got a sexual harassment complaint against him from the woman he rejected. She said that he made her uncomfortable by bringing up something she said while intoxicated and was talking about relationships to her (by saying he was married) which she felt was inappropriate for work. He explained the situation to them and they seemed to understand, saying that he should have told them first, but that they understand and it just seems like a communication issue.

Now his supervisor is upset with him as multiple computer stations in the office were messy, which he is supposed to stay on top of as an operations manager, though each worker is supposed to help clean too and one left moldy food under her desk for days, which he did not see but he’s in trouble for. He also did not restock the correct office food in the fridge and used the old list by accident. He also stayed overtime after his supervisor told him not to. I know he’s made mistakes in this job and I don’t want him to get fired. I’ve been a stay at home mom for the past 7 years and had limited career experience before that because I had our first in my early 20’s and haven’t worked since, so I honestly don’t really know how these things go. Do you think they are going to fire him honestly? How, if there is any way, can he prevent this?

AskHR,1otqmti,2025-11-10T21:30:14+00:00,2,4,[CA] Told to rush a plaque project at a public college — discovered licensing is required but HR says it’s “personal use.” Conflicting guidance.,"I work at a public community college in a role that often involves ordering materials and coordinating projects. Recently, I was assigned to produce a plaque featuring an article/photo from a major national newspaper.

I was chastised by my supervisors for “moving too slowly,” even though I hadn’t yet received the necessary materials (photo files) or confirmation of the licensing requirements. When I contacted the newspaper directly, they told me clearly that reproducing their article/photo on a physical item like a plaque requires licensing and goes through a specific permissions process.

Because licensing hadn’t been clarified, I paused briefly out of caution so I wouldn’t accidentally put the institution at legal risk. Once I finally received the files, I placed the order immediately.

The issue:
	•	My supervisors insist this falls under “personal use,” so no licensing is needed.
	•	HR is supporting that “personal use” interpretation.
	•	But the union rep I consulted said that if we’re using public funds, then it’s absolutely not personal use, and it could be problematic.
	•	Major newspapers (e.g., NYT/WaPo) categorize plaques as “business use,” not personal use, and require licensing fees.

I don’t want to get in trouble for following instructions if this turns out to be a copyright issue. I also don’t want to ignore a licensing requirement and potentially create legal or financial liability for the college.

My questions:
	1.	Is reproducing a newspaper article/photo on a plaque for a public educational institution truly “personal use”?
	2.	Should public funds ever be used for something classified as “personal use”?
	3.	How should I protect myself when I’m receiving conflicting guidance from management, HR, and the union?

I’m not naming my employer or anyone involved — I just want to understand the copyright and workplace implications so I can do my job correctly and safely.

Any insight from HR professionals, copyright experts, or people familiar with public sector compliance would be really helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1otqmti/ca_told_to_rush_a_plaque_project_at_a_public/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1otqmti/ca_told_to_rush_a_plaque_project_at_a_public/

They say the MERP will reimburse 100% of out of pocket expenses including deductibles and co-pays for all providers & pharmacy; 100% of facility fee out-of-pocket within their hospital system; and 70% of facility fee out-of-pocket costs outside their hospital system. 

I've never heard of this type of plan. Raises red flags because it seems to just shift cost to a spouse. Spouse 1, for the record, is ineligible to even enroll as a spouse 2 dependent because they won't cover spouses with ACCESS to group insurance coverage. Just feels sleazy. What are the red flags to look for? What fine print should I be looking for? Is this a ""bad"" plan to avoid? I avoided HDHP the first few years they were offered because of fear. Then, after talking to peers, realized it was a good fit for me. Help me out. We would schedule a meeting with HR, but it's  a massive corporation that keeps HR at arm's length and difficult to even reach.

AskHR,1otl0fz,2025-11-10T18:03:53+00:00,4,8,"[FL] Moved to role I don’t have skills for, then given a poor review","About six months ago, my leader retired and was moved to a new team. I’m a mid-level manager and my job at the time (and my background and expertise) was in employee engagement and learning & development. (I’ve posted about this previously.) I reported to John for about four months, learning finance and analytics as best as I could. Then we had a reorg and I was moved to Julie’s team which is parallel work but deeper in the financial analytics which is a field in which I have zero background or experience. She has restructured where she can to accommodate the skills I *can* contribute but we have all agreed that this is not a good fit for me. Unfortunately there is no other work they can move me to. (In fact, I had to hand off part of my previous work to a former peer of mine who was moved to another team but they don’t have any openings.)

For the last 12 months, I have also been applying for other internal positions in my company for which I am well qualified - over 20 of them - but I have not gotten a single interview. I am working with an internal mobility recruiter but it hasn’t helped. Recently, Julie has started reaching out to hiring managers for those positions after I apply and reach out. 

Last week, I received my year-end review and it was below expectations because I don’t have any experience or knowledge in this area and much as I might like to, learning high-level financial planning and analytics doesn’t happen overnight. This is the first poor review I’ve received in my career; I’ve always been an “exceeds expectations” type. It has hit me hard emotionally but I also feel, to be candid, that this doesn’t seem fair. Of course I’m not qualified for this job but you put me here! However, I’m almost 30 years into my career so I know “fair” doesn’t matter; it’s just business. That bein said, I have to admit that I’m starting to wonder if my age is a factor here. Additionally, my leader has acknowledged verbally (as has her leader) that I am improving and making progress but they seem reluctant to put that in writing in my review. This makes it feel like a setup to PIP and fire me. 

So, I arranged a meeting with our HR manager (with my leader’s knowledge and blessing) to talk about options and next steps. This brings me to my question: **What is the best way for me to handle this conversation with HR?** I am certain that the HR manager will report back to my leadership chain so I want it to be a productive and professional meeting. 

I would like to ask for increased consideration when I apply for internal jobs and/or some kind of assistance getting back into a job I’m qualified for. My human side wants to scream *”How is any of this fair or ethical?”* but I know screaming won’t get me anywhere. Is that a reasonable point to bring up, though, if I do it professionally?

Any guidance and recommendations are appreciated!

AskHR,1otk7na,2025-11-10T17:35:26+00:00,0,13,HR Investigation question [AL],"I am getting conflicting answers from two HR people I personally know, so I figured I would try here to see if I can get some clarity. This is in relation to an issue with a friend at a previous company, and he has been a consistent performer at his company for the past 7 years, always getting high marks at review time, and constant praise from patients.

His company is doing an investigation against his direct manager. My buddy (and 1 other person that they both know about) was a witness to a few unethical things, and after it was reported to HR/Compliance, the manager was under investigation. What bothers my buddy the most is that HR when setting up the times to meet, they cc'd his manager on the emails. They stated something to the effect of there being a compliance investigation and we need to talk to you.

There were only two nurses being questioned, my buddy and another nurse. The other nurse told my buddy a few weeks later that after their HR call, they immediately then called their manager and telling them they said nothing during their HR call. This leaves only my buddy as the source. While I understand that part is hearsay, my main question is this...

Is it normal for HR to include the person being investigated on the email to the witnesses? I can see the manager side so the manager knows they will be out of office/unavailable... but in this instance with the manager being the sole reason for complaint, it has now opened him up to being retaliated against. There is a lot more I won't dive into, but to me the integrity of the investigation is now gone since the manager knew WHO was being talked to, and was able to easily find out who said what.

AskHR,1otk2w1,2025-11-10T17:30:41+00:00,0,33,[CA] Maternity leave and resignation,"Hello, me again 😅

I am currently on calendar day 26 back from maternity leave. I had let my company know a month before returning that child care would be an issue for me and requested to work from home. My request was denied therefore I returned on the required day.

The child care issue has not gone away, my mother took some time off of work to help me out while I returned to work for the 30 days so as to avoid paying back my insurance premium. This will now leave me to have to flat out resign on the final day of being back or offer to formally give my two weeks notice if they will allow me to serve them from home. I don’t want to leave on back terms but I have no other choice but to resign or work from home for the two weeks or work from home indefinitely if they choose to change their minds.

My question is, is the 30 days a legal matter? Because this is not outlined in our company handbook. There is no mention of returning to work or we have to pay back the premiums. My hr is extremely unprofessional and either doesnt seem to know the laws or chooses to screw over their employee.

If the 30 calendar days is not legally important then I would give them a 1 week notice at least with the offer to work from home for the second week or indefinitely.

If legally I need to work 30 calendar days to avoid paying back my premium then I would be forced to resign end of day this Friday and give the option of two weeks notice working from home or indefinitely.

OR come in on Monday with my baby and resign then and there.

AskHR,1otj1s4,2025-11-10T16:53:43+00:00,0,3,[IL] When and if to disclose sealed felony,"Hey everyone,

Was hoping someone could shed some light as to what steps I should take moving forward.

I recently received a conditional offer as an IT employee at a local (Chicago) health care facility.

I had a few felonies on my record from 8 years ago for retail theft that I had sealed. Throughout the interview process, I had not disclosed any of these felonies (It was never brought up in the interview or on the application and I was under the impression that I am not required to disclose sealed records).

Anyway, I came to find out that I had to complete a fingerprint background as this position falls under healthcare. I've completed the fingerprinting but am assuming it will come back with a hit as this company probably falls outside the rules outlined for using sealed convictions in hiring decisions.

My question is

1. Should I get ahead of this and reach out to HR. I was never asked about a record until the offer was made, but I don't want to come off in a way which seems like I am hiding something.

2. If I do reach out, is there a way to ""sell myself"". The retail theft were committed almost a decade ago while I was suffering from active addiction. Since then, I have been clean for the past 9 years (spent some time in a local jail before the conviction), completed my Bachelors and Masters degree, have held various corporate roles, and have worked as an intern for a non-profit that focuses on preparing young adults with the skills needed to enter the workforce. Additionally, my partner is a public school teacher who could provide additional support as to how I've changed my life.

I'm currently accepted that I probably lost the opportunity, but I wanted to make sure I exhausted every option to make this work out. While it isn't the end of the world, I love that it is a local company that helps to improve my community and I really want to be a part of that.

It's a L1 round I attended, the interview went good actually. At the end of the call, my interviewer kinda ended with a positive note hinting that I am fit for the role - ""Thanks {my name}, our tech stack are almost similar, and we  use these tools and languages in our current project. Great having this session with you. I will update my feedback to the recruitment coordinator"".

This kinda made me excited because I have been trying to get an interview opportunity at this org for months. 


Coming to my actual doubts - my recruitment HR haven't got back to me yet. I thought I would give it a day. But it's been 3 working days this far. 

I would like to know whether there are internal clearings and approvals that needs to be done before contacting me?

Are there any process going in background that's causing delay?

AskHR,1ot6mpq,2025-11-10T06:30:21+00:00,0,11,[BA] Report a supervisor?,"Greetings all.

Well I wanted to check is there a proper way to report a supervisor that will actually get some results.

Some background on the situation.
Im working for a corporate office and im in the IT support department. [ I won't get into detail what company ]

I been working there for a few years by now and it's a ok company nothing special honestly.
Pay really sucks but im activity looks for something better on the side.

Anyway back to the main issue.

Our team has more supervisor not just one since it's a bigger team so closer to 7 or 8 supervisors.

Most of them are ok they do their thing they do not bother anyone unless nessery and even then they try to be professional and polite.

Off course besides that one guy that we all hate.
So that supervisor usually dose not do much besides arguing with the employees.
He is rude screams at people threats them with written warnings HR cases and all the above 

Scream at new employees is nothing new to him or arguing with older employees [ Age wise ]

He keeps threatening employees on public Teams chats that they can not ask for help or side chat anyone or they will get a Written Warning even tho it's a new employees or someone that got confused at a moment.

That supervisor has some HR cases on his name but since we are a corporate company HR dose not do anything about it. They usually let it slide because some reason.

His boss that is our manager supports him because ""he keeps the team in line"".

Of course that's besides the nepotism going on in the team and favoritism to some employees that can spend 2h on a lunch brake even tho it's only 30 minutes 

So yeah im not sure how to deal with this corporate bs anymore.

I have some screenshot of the harassment but im not sure will HR do anything about it, I do not trust HR that much because they usually take sides with the management to my experience with this and other companies.

AskHR,1ot5fw3,2025-11-10T05:20:19+00:00,0,3,[CAN-BC] Do I have grounds for constructive dismissal?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve worked for a company in BC, Canada for over 3 years with excellent performance. Some time after a re-org, my new acting manager started demanding very detailed daily time-tracking (on exact time basis, and expected time needed to finish tasks). The manager was acting on a feedback from a former manager, who gave me excellent annual reviews before, but later criticized me publicly and questioning whether I am competent and if work at all, while having doubts about my efficiency and workload.

I started noticing the signs burnout in the last few months, because of a constant work overload and pressure. Our projects don’t have a proper finish, no breathing room in between. Before one finishes, another has already started, not mentioning the constant fire-fighting. This experience created an excessive stress and inevitable burnout combined with an anxiety, confirmed by my doctor and psychiatrist. I’m planning to speak with an employment lawyer, but would like to hear whether this sounds like a constructive-dismissal situation others have faced.

My employment contract doesn’t contain a clear severance clause. It just references termination “in accordance with applicable employment standards,” without specific notice or payment terms. From what I understand, that means I’d fall under the default rules in my province (BC), which could make me eligible for common-law severance if I’m terminated or constructively dismissed.

Anyway, I am careaid, work with severely mentally disabled people, they can't walk or talk and need to be changed every few hours. A few months ago a resident passed away and we have a new resident. He is the most complex resident I have ever seen. Mentally disabled, pica, diabetic, likes pulling on his G-Tube, like picking at his wounds. It's long story and I am tired, they didn't give me any training on him despite him being the most difficult resident I have ever seen. I told them for days, I told the nurse and all my coworkers I couldn't handle him, but they just brushed me off saying, ""I will be fine"".

I told my boss I want to transfer because I can't handle the stress, she said transfering takes 6 months. Last week I tried to transfer him using his complicated jungle gym of a chair that I told repeatedly I didn't know how to work it, but they ignored me. Anyway, almost dropped him, but called for help. Then I left the room crying and called my boss saying I can't handle it.

Anyway, next day he called me before work telling me to take today off, then the next day HR lady told me that ""I am stressed and I keep using profanity"". Let me tell you a secret, careaids use profanity like a second language. I told her I didn't get any training on him, her response was, ""All houses have complex residents with special needs"". I know that's bullshit, I floated to other houses and never encounted someone at that level. I literally took care of a guy with a trachea thing attached to his throat and I didn't find him ""complex"".

So, she said, I am on leave. Its been a week.

Just waiting, I doubt I am fired, it's so hard to get fired at my job. Been here for 2 years and only saw two people fired. One was purposelessly being dangerous and aggressive to our residents and the other ODed at work. We are so depesate for people, now we are hiring people who can't speak English.

Do you know how hard it is explaining to someone that a resident is having a seizure and he needs to get the nurse and he doesn't speak English? It's really fuckng hard, I know, I did that twice.

Anyway, I called my coworker and friend on the inside. No one investigated me and my name is still on the schedule book. It is just marked as red. When your name is red, it means you were scheduled, but you used a vacation day, sick day, jury duty, whatever. So, technically I am still hired.

I kinda just wish they would either fire me so I can apply for the other 10 careaid positions near me or just tell me I am coming back in tomorrow and actually getting training. Been spending the past week playing Factorio and have AI write terrible fanfictions about cat people.

AskHR,1osz60n,2025-11-10T00:09:07+00:00,0,22,[LA] manager is targeting me/trying to make me quit,"there’s a few parts to this situation, but i will try and keep it brief. i work in retail sales and feel as if my manager of 2 yrs is possibly targeting me or is trying to “catch me” doing something in which i am not so that they can fire me. or they are just simply trying to make me quit

incident 1: fake observation report. we have monthly observations that are customer interaction focused. in a recent month’s observation, he stated this was a “quick observe” and went on to write an extremely vague list of daily tasks (that had been done) with question marks behind each- i take this as implying that these tasks were told to be done and were not done. upon reading the observation my next shift, i took a picture. during my “observed” shift i clocked out once my manager clocked in and i witnessed my manager entering the building, then walk straight to the sales counter where i was. this understandably concerned me that they would write a “negative” report for an observation that i didn’t feel fair because it didn’t happen. when brought up during my next shift with them, they stuck with their original observation and even claimed that they had entered the building and then stood around for a few minutes observing my behavior from afar- which i know for a fact did not happen as i witnessed them entering the building (there is camera footage). the conversation then escalated into a very loud argument, and manager ended up using white-out to erase the observation. this happened at the very beginning of the month and the had ample time to conduct another observation- which was all that i was asking for. that did not happen- i still do not have a recorded observation for that month.

incident 2: dress code & insubordination insinuation. our dress code policy has been updated and when manager asked me if i would like to go upstairs and speak to HR myself regarding any questions i had, i simply stated that i was not interested and would also not be purchasing the new jacket (*edit: for clarification this jacket is OPTIONAL and not a required part of uniform. we are not however allowed to wear any OTHER outwerwear) & will just do without. they proceeded to tell me that if i refused to follow dress code then disciplinary action would be followed, to which i explained that i am aware of the definition of insubordination and am not refusing to FOLLOW dress code, but am making them aware that i will not be opting to purchasing something & will just not wear any jacket (this is completely within our dress code and we are not required to wear it). this led to yet another escalation & i was then yelled at for being difficult. 

incident 3: late policy. a full time position opened up and i was asked if i had any concerns moving forward, to which i responded that meeting 20 hours per week minimum is my only concern. manager said that in a meeting with RM they would be discussing hours promised. the very next sentence said was that there was also a time sheet report that will be reviewed with RM because i clocked in 3 minutes late to my shift multiple days that week. i brought up our late policy which states that after 5 minutes is considered “late”. this was met with pushback and “since when” then followed by saying we (myself & manager) will need to discuss a grace period within the 5 minute grace period because “i am abusing the policy”. this conversation also escalated.

if you have made it this far, there are plenty more instances in which my manager has stolen sales from me, singled me out among coworkers, micromanages, and too many other things to even list. i have evidence of every backhanded, rude, false thing they have said/written/texted to me and have started collecting voice memos. i do not know where to go from here, another employee was dealing with this same thing (same manager) and ended up quitting. i fear they are attempting to do the same to me and just want to have my bases covered. i don’t want to quit my job, but i am a college student and this manager is making my life miserable. i’m also not even sure if any of these incidents are even viable to bring to HR. thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1osz60n/la_manager_is_targeting_metrying_to_make_me_quit/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1osz60n/la_manager_is_targeting_metrying_to_make_me_quit/

The structure is very flat. There are managers, analysts, specialists, seniors or juniors, but we all report to one person with a director title. Most decisions, also those about whether to keep a new team member long term, are made collectively by the whole team by voting.

There are no clear expectations for me. I’m basically supposed to “do the job” and “get along with everyone,” and that’s how I’ll be assessed. It feels very subjective. There is also no clear division of responsibilities, multiple people within the team do the same tasks I do, and I’m still not sure how I’m supposed to choose what to take on.

My previous job was the opposite with well-defined measures, clear reporting lines, and structured responsibilities. I actually liked that, because it left little room for politics or manipulation, despite promotions, but it's not what I am here for.

In my previous job I was considered as a respectful, professional and a collaborative person. I like working together toward a shared result, however, I’m also somewhat private when it comes to personal stuff. This new group, though, is very socially close and outgoing. On my second day, I was told I “don’t seem to be having as much fun” as I should, and that everyone here is “very open and colorful.”

Now I’m already noticing gossip about me, side chats, and meetings I’m not included in. I get the sense that I’m being judged on things beyond my professional performance. Some people appear to feel threatened by me, and I’m trying hard to show I’m humble and im not trying to hijack anyone's status, position or whatever, but it doesn’t seem to land yet.

What’s confusing is that they don’t seem to be that truly close with each other either. There’s definitely some internal politics I don’t understand yet. One person in particular keeps positioning himself as someone who “manages” me, offering to help with HR matters, access, etc. having formal weekly status meetings, even though he’s not my manager. He's also very eager to hear my ideas on how to improve existing processes and I know I keep somewhat ""value"" in his eyes due to my experience and knowledge.

The role itself is very interesting, and I’d love to stay here at least a year or two to learn and contribute. But the last thing I want is to get caught up in office politics I don’t understand, especially when I feel like I’m already on the outside.

I am a disabled person suffering from Autistic traits and migraines. I am on the waiting list to be referred to the Autistic Society for assessment but I have found that for the last 4 years I have been experiencing mental health problems in work since our employers moved us out of a small locked room into a large open plan wing. I cannot bear the bright lights, noise, smells, and temperatures within the office and I have worked with my employer to introduce reasonable adjustments, which there have been many, but none of them work and because I have terrible social anxiety and I am finding the thought of going into the office terrifying.

I put in for a flexible working request to work from home as an adjustment but they declined it without a business reason (which they must do by law) and said that they had provided enough reasonable adjustments. I appealed the decision and the appeal was turned down also without a business reason. I queried why there was no business reason but they refused to comment.

I have had occupational health referrals detailing my issues and a recent neuro-divergent occupational health that recommended that I work from home for the foreseeable future. I also have current fit notes saying I am available for work but only if I work from home. I already perform 67% of my job from home anyway and working from home 100% would bring no detriment to the team. We worked from home during COVID. Other team members have had their occupational health advise followed when it brought severe disruption to the team.

After that occ health referral in June, my manager said he would investigate what the referral meant to the business and get back to me, but I had no chat about it and now he has initiated a formal performance hearing because attending the office is attached to performance, yet I am one of the best members in my team and have had outstanding performance reviews, the last one being in April.

I have had no informal meetings and my managers no longer talk to me verbally, just through emails when they want to. I believe that they are not supporting me and I have no idea what they are telling senior leaders but I have heard that they are not happy with me and I have no clue why.

I have continued to work from home during the days I was meant to be in the office but now I am worried about my future and I am really worried about my mental health and what is going to happen.

I cannot lose my job but the thought of going into work makes me want to cry. I feel like the management are biased and there is something more at play like they don't want people applying to work from home so I am being scapegoated or something. I am at stage 1 disciplinary at the moment and I have my hearing on Friday 14th Nov 2025, but stage 3 is independent and should be from another office so that is my best chance of success but it's leaving it very close to potential sacking.

AskHR,1osbqbo,2025-11-09T06:02:33+00:00,0,4,[FL] Hiring manager informed compensation offered may not be at the starting rate of role due to percentile limit of raise with internal transfers.,"Hello, I have just recently had a job interview, and the manager discussed compensation for me if I get the role. He informed me that he is offering a certain rate for the position, however I may not be able to be compensated at the role’s starting rate due to that exceeding a certain percentile raise from my current rate. He informed me that HR only allows raises to a certain percentile when transferring internally. 

This role is a change in departments. I will be going from a more general customer service/dispatch role to a level II ITAM role where I offer certifications, years of applicable technical experience, and high qualifications, much of which are not very valued in my customer service role. There is also interest in using my technical experience that go broader than the specific scope of the role. I am very interested in the position, however I would like to negotiate for myself for to be compensated at the rate of an IT professional, not a former customer service professional.

AskHR,1osa1ze,2025-11-09T04:31:00+00:00,0,17,[AZ] how to confront boss that doesn’t understand sick pay,"ok this is really confusing and my place of work is really not put together and this makes it pretty obvious.

ive been working here since march. as far as i remember, orientation let us know we dont get any benefits. so i was wondering about my paid sick leave, how many hours i have etc.  i was poking around my work app (homebase) and went to put in a request for time off with paid sick leave just to see how many hours i have, but i realized that no matter how many hours i go to request off it says i have a negative amount afterwards? sorry if that doesnt make sense. this is my first job im only 19.

so i went to my gm (i have 2 bosses. the owner of the store, were a franchise, and my gm) and asked her where in homebase i could see how many sick hours ive built up, only asking her cuz it would be annoying to add all that up yknow, and she goes “oh you dont have any, none of you do”

i was confused because as far as i know, with the multiple jobs my boyfriend has had, its arizona law? so i said exactly that in response, and she said she’d look into it.

i go into the break room like 20 minutes later and shes on her computer looking up the law, its like fair wages and families act i think. and she i swear to god barely skimmed through it before she turned to me and said “so you guys dont get any. we dont have enough employees. sorry. ill talk to owner and see if theres anything i can do”

so she like vitally misunderstood what the law was saying because she hardly skimmed through it + was in a rush to leave that night. i guess she thought that if you have 15 or less employees you dont have to pay sick leave at all?? but that is not true lol its that they get less sick hours than if tou had 15 or more.  i also looked around the building today while i was at work and didnt see the paper thats legally required to be posted somewhere stating the sick hours laws lol

so i guess im posting here to ask what i do next? that was monday night nov 3rd. obviously it’s saturday lol i still havent heard anything from her about it. do i try to talk to her and let her know she was wrong? do i go to the owner and let him know about the situation and that we should be receiving sick hours? im going to hawaii on the 13th and returning the 17th, should i say something now or wait until i come back? or do i not say anything at all and see if she really does talk to the owner and “see what she can do” because i was also thinking she does that and they look into again and realize what they did wrong without me even saying anytning

i do want to add because i think it’s important: we get paid biweekly on fridays. we didnt get paid friday and when i texted her to ask why she said that gusto (our payroll app) had a virus? and that there was a shutdown with the app. and now were getting paid Wednesday. i dont know if this is true or not lol i dont know anyone that uses gusto that isnt one of my coworkers so i wasnt sure who to ask if anyone else is experiencing this.

AskHR,1orqyl7,2025-11-08T14:36:59+00:00,0,13,[NY] FMLA + PFL - questions about returning to work in a service/restaurant shift-based setting,"I am wondering if I am overreacting to something that has occurred at my job in regards to my pregnancy and parental leave.

background: I work as a server at a restaurant in NYC, have for 4 years. Myself and all other FOH employees, with a couple exceptions, are required to be on the schedule for 4 shifts, no more no less (but we can cover/get coverage as needed. this ends up being 20-28 hours on average. In a given shift (5-7 hours) we make about 300-400 dollars on average, so a shift is significant income. 20 hours is also the threshold for being eligible for health insurance at this company.

In February I told management that I was pregnant, due in mid-July. I discussed with them at that point that I would be planning on working until close to, if not right up until the baby was born. As my pregnancy progressed and it got less possible for me to do the tasks of serving, my schedule included more hosting than serving shifts but was still 4 shifts, and at least 20 hours a week, because I was diligent about making sure I kept insurance.

Four weeks before my due date, I had a conversation with a manager where I said I would probably work until a week before my due date. A couple days later, that same manager said the following: that there wasn't going to be room in the schedule for me after that week because outdoor dining was ramping up and they were going to have to hire someone (or more than one person) to both replace me and cover the additional sections, and they didn't want to keep me on the schedule if I could go into labor at any time. So like, wouldn't it make sense to go on temp disability / leave. I felt pressured into accepting this but am on good terms with everyone, also it made logical sense because I was literally 9 months pregnant and huge (but managing my tasks fine and still feeling good!). Anyway, so I went on temporary disability three weeks before my due date, instead of one week as planned.

For more background, NY State temp disability is VERY LOW at $170ish dollars but my company matched it, so it was about 350 a week. still low for NYC. In NY you aren't eligible for paid family leave until the baby is born, which is a percentage of your income. anyway.

so the baby is born almost a week late, making it four weeks of disability to that point and it was a significantly stressful month financially. to make matters worse, the company's insurance got my claims wrong and kept me on the temp disability for two more weeks before the parental leave kicked in, and when it finally did go through the payment was delayed about a week. But that was just an unfortunate thing. needless to say, was a stressful 6 weeks. but then I was getting paid family leave and things were fine. from baby's birth, I took all 12 weeks I was eligible for as planned (though 2 of those weeks were actually temp disability still, so I think I still have two weeks of leave to take within the first year?) Anyway.

Flash forward a week before the end of my leave. I email the manager and tell them my scheduling requirements will be slightly different to allow for childcare responsibilities but I have open availability weekends still, and can work certain shifts on weekdays (any weekday). given that I still assume 4 shifts is the standard, I would presumably work two weekday shifts, two weekend. The manager gets back to me and says they can only give me 2-4 for the first month because I am only covering PTO for other staff and there isn't room in the schedule. So for the first month back, I work average 3 shifts a week, approx. 16 hours a week average. A few days ago, regarding November, the same manager says they ""didn't want to take the shifts from other people, so they will get me on a set schedule as soon as things open up"".

Then here is the thing that is really bothering me. The event that is going to open things up is actually another employee going on parental leave, as their partner is going into labor any day now. This employee is still on the schedule for four shifts a week. So my ability to return to work at my normal amount of shifts/hours/income is contingent on this employee going on leave. My own income was basically cut on the front end because I was pregnant and it was unpredictable, but is cut now because someone else is.

I am not sure if they violated policies or if it just feels to me like they did? Is it legal to have a temporarily reduced schedule while they wait for others to leave and the schedule to open up? I don't know how to approach this with HR because basically the other baby will be born any day and I'll work four shifts again. So it won't really matter going forward. I like my job, the manager in question, the other employee, etc. But I can't help but feel like this not cool. And possibly was illegal and retaliatory? From my understanding, upon my return to leave I was legally supposed to have the same amount of shifts/hours as before.

Looking for insight into what I should do, or if there is anything that would even happen at this point. How would something like this go normally? Did my agreeing to all this was essentially just nullifying any ""case"" I have. not that I want to sue them... I don't know what I want to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1orqyl7/ny_fmla_pfl_questions_about_returning_to_work_in/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1orqyl7/ny_fmla_pfl_questions_about_returning_to_work_in/

AskHR,1orbk8z,2025-11-08T00:45:39+00:00,0,2,"[CA] Please Help A Struggling College Student's Situation, Need Advice","Hello, I am in a rough situation and some input and guidance on my situation as HR is a field that's hard to understand since a lot of stuff is not public information.

I am a college student that is currently a senior, about 2 years ago when I was much more immature, I had been working for a housing job at my school in one of the dorms. Basically my job was sitting at the desk and filling out work orders (maintenance requests), helping students that were locked out, answering the phone, etc. This was the second job I ever had, my first job was at a fast food place so I didn't really build good habits and slacked around a lot. 

Basically, after 3-4 months of working this desk job I was fired. I'm doing my best to be unbiased as possible, I will try to state facts since I am merely looking for advice and have no reason to hide anything. There was NO specific reasoning for my release from employment in my employment letter, however I believe it was a culmination of 3 things.

1. This job was very strict, you couldn't sit in a chair after 8am (this is a 24 hour shift job so if you worked from like 10pm-8am you were allowed to sit, but after 8am you required to stand) and I was called out 3 times for sitting in a chair after 8am. I AM NOT making excuses, I did break the rules and sat in the chair, however, I did have a broken leg during 2nd month I had worked there (doctor documented + note and I had time off + crutches for 3 weeks) and it was hard for me to stand for hours and hours on end. So yes, I did sit down a couple of times when I wasn't supposed to and each time I was lectured. This is my fault because I didn't ask for accomodations to sit down, but at the time I was immature and didn't think it was a big deal.

2. I didn't suck up to my manager. I'm NOT saying my manager was a bad person, however, my job is primarily a lot of girls (about 80%) and I am a guy, so while girls would constantly have conversations with my much older manager basically making him feel good and laughing at his jokes, I wouldn't really do that and mainly just reply to any questions my boss had for me and made minimal conversation. I overheard from a coworker that this annoyed my boss, but I never thought much of it. 

3. There was one incident where during move in week for college we had some carts that people could check out to get stuff from their car to their dorm. I worked (3) shifts during this move in period but during one of the shifts, our computer was having issues and I had to manually write down the people who checked out the cart's IDs and was required to manually fill them into the system when it came back up. For some reason, I was accused of telling people that they could just take carts without checking them out, which was never the case. The 1st and 3rd day when the system was up and running I perfectly documented all checkin/checkouts of the carts, but during the day it was down when I was recording all the IDs by hand, my boss told me that ""someone accused me of letting people check out carts without giving me their ID"" which was 100% not true because firstly, I know there's cameras in the building and I wouldn't risk my job for this, and secondly, I HAD THE PHYSICAL PAPER WITH ALL THE IDS! The only thing is that I was accused of this 2 weeks after it happened and I had thrown away the paper after I had inputted the IDs, so I didn't have proof that I did actually record the IDs. I asked him to pull up the file or software that we used to show that I really did input all the IDs and never told people to take cares without checking them out but he said that the software resets after each day. He just said that one of my coworkers accused me of it but never told me who and it was a ""he said, she said"" type of situation. 

  
I'm not saying I was a perfect employee, but the 3 things above were the ONLY times I ever was called in to talk to my manager. Thus, when I was released from my job It was totally out of the blue. I talked to my coworkers (who I became friends with most of them) after I had left and they said that my manager didn't like the ""vibe"" that I brought and wanted to replace me with another girl that had been wanting to work there but couldn't because we were full.

  
My question is, I am now a senior applying for real world jobs, however, I have this specific job on my resume since I don't have a ton of other experience. I actually applied to another job after my sophomore year but since it was also at my college, even though I passed the interview and was offered a position, when they reached out to my previous employer (this job), I had my job offer **rescinded.** Since the jobs I am applying for now are full time jobs are in Finance, a lot of them ask if they can reach out to my previous employers and ask for reference numbers. I usually give my first job (fast food)'s referral number since I have a strong connection with my manager there, but I would like to know, in California, can an employer actually reach out to this manager that fired me and ask them questions about my firing? Note, I was NEVER written up during my time at this job, I was literally let go without a warning. However, I am worried that this job will prevent me from getting any future jobs due to how strict and tough it is to get a finance job.

My other choice is to leave this job off my resume entirely, however, I am worried that if a big finance firm does a background check and sees that I left this job off my resume, they may do an even deeper inquiry and find out regardless (and then i have less experience I can show on my resume to boot). Does anyone know what employers can actually reach out to my old department to ask them questions about why I was fired?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1orbk8z/ca_please_help_a_struggling_college_students/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1orbk8z/ca_please_help_a_struggling_college_students/
AskHR,1or6n8l,2025-11-07T21:20:04+00:00,0,11,[CAN-ON] is 3 weeks after last communication too late to escalate concerns up to HR?,"Is 3 weeks after communication reasonable to reach out to HR ?Canada - ON

Back story; 
I've been off work since June from a car accident, I suffered a concussion, vestibular disturbance/dysfunction and whiplash - I've been under the care of a neuro,vestibular, concussion specialist and was cleared to return to work PART TIME with accommodations beginning of October, accommodations that were required were
"" No swing/overnight shifts "" * I usually rotate between days, nights and swings *
"" No lifting above 25lb ""
"" Limited screen time "" * I'm only on screens for about 20-30 minutes for a shift *
"" Shorter shift lengths ""
After completing all the paperwork my part-time employer asked me to fill out and get my physician to fill out, it was radio silent until about a week and a half when I followed up again, to which my employer did respond and just said ""After reviewing this in detail, I do not believe we are able to accommodate these return-to-work requirements. Is it possible for you to remain off work until you are full recovered and able to return to full duties?"" And asked for a timeline of my return.
I responded, said being completely off work will hinder my recovery and that I need to be able to return to work and build my tolerance to everything at work, so I can find out if anything triggers my symptoms or flares my symptoms etc and thats why it's reccomended I return part time with these accommodations and asked for written clarification on WHY they felt I couldn't be accommodated. I'm again, waiting for over a week, I followed up and again asked for written clarification on WHY , to also let them know I'm still scheduled for a full 12 hour shift, with no accommodations and that I won't be able to safely perform my shift as well as asked to have my employers response by Oct 17, 2025.
To which my managers reply was abrasive, uninformative and frankly, unprofessional... I won't share the whole response but no clarification on why the accomodations aren't something they can meet - "" The accommodations provided were quite extensive and not something we can manage with your current schedule. You are only scheduled for two overnight shifts per month, and while I understand you have more availability at the moment, we do not have additional shifts available to you. "" --
I can see the schedule, I can see that's there's open shifts available - at that exact time there was 5, 4 hour shifts available that would've aligned with my accommodations to return to work and a few other 8 hours shifts, that could've been adjusted to accommodate me, and no where in my terms of employment does it state I'm only to work 2 overnight shifts per month, I'm required to work a minimum of 24 hours per month, any shift but I just have to work 24 hours per month. There's still currently shifts open and available to date. In that same email, my employer requested I get another doctor note to continue to be off on medical leave until I can return to full duties, no doctor will give me a note to say I'm staying on medical leave when I've been medically cleared to work, with accommodations ....

The last communication was 3 weeks ago, from my manager and I didn't respond as we're just going in circles, it's unproductive, and I'm not getting the clarification I've asked for, and the tone of the communication from my manager changed into a abrasive one... Is 3 weeks too long to wait to escalate this up to HR as a formal concern? 
*My specialist has told me to escalate this issue further and consider going to the tribunal as a potential human rights code violation has happened* curious about this but I've never been in this situation and I'm just unsure what my next steps should be... I just want to return to work and start having my ""normal"" life back. Any suggestions, advice, ""I've been through this"" etc is welcome. Thank you!


TL;DR - I’ve been off work since June due to a car accident causing concussion, vestibular dysfunction, and whiplash. I WAS cleared to return part-time in October with accommodations (no swings/overnights, lifting under 25 lbs, limited screen time, shorter shifts).

After submitting paperwork, my employer delayed responding, then said they couldn’t accommodate my restrictions and asked me to  stay off work until fully recovered. I requested written clarification on reasoning for denial of accommodations and noted I was scheduled for full 12-hour shifts you can’t safely perform. Employer’s reply was unprofessional, vague, and factually inaccurate, claimed shifts weren't available when I could see open, suitable shifts existed.

It’s been 3 weeks since the last communication from my manager. Too long to wait to escalate concerns or can should concerns be escalated?

I just returned recently, and my **manager immediately told me I’m being placed on a PIP or should accept a “mutual separation.”**  
The justification? Supposedly **poor performance from mid- to late-2024**, which was a period when I was either already on protected leave for the most part or only worked about 6 weeks ( Where i received no negative review) before going out.

When I asked why this wasn’t discussed earlier, my manager said he *“couldn’t share the feedback because I was on leave”* and was *“waiting for me to come back.”*

Here’s what feels off:

* I wasn’t active employment in the **next two review cycles** because I was on leave.
* I’ve **never had a formal performance review or written warning** since joining.
* **No documentation** has been provided — they’re just asking me to “take severance,” on chat and then resign voluntarily but **I haven’t received any written document.**
* **Ive being asked to resign without documentation for a review cycle from a year ago - for which I was mostly on protected leave**",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1or6cbv/ca_is_this_legal_big_tech_company_wants_me_to/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1or6cbv/ca_is_this_legal_big_tech_company_wants_me_to/

I work in the IT field and have heard mixed things about whether companies are drug testing for employment. I’ve smoked weed for some time, and so I’ve been applying to jobs that don’t list screenings as a requirement. All that being said, during my last round of interviews the HR director mentioned that the job offer would be contingent on various things, and at the end quietly mentions a drug screening. 

So my question is this: should I be honest with the company if the offer is extended to me? do I decline the offer to save them time? or should I take the test, probably fail, and then see what happens from there?

The option I am given is to go back to my previous lower position with no changes to my current salary or if decide do not want this move, the other option would be to exit the company. 

Will there be severance package if choose to leave the company instead? If there is, will there be an impact to what will be offered because declined the lower position they offered? 

If the numbers are not disclosed during our conversation (was given a couple of days to think about my decision), once tell them I'm going to choose the exit option and i find out the severance is not good, will i still be able to change my mind and maybe choose the other option instead? Or not really and I'm stuck with the exit option?

My boss hired me and my PT employee around the same time, so I was not part of hiring her. Anyway, I’m struggling on how to proceed with this employee. There’s certain, basic things she should know how to do after a year in this position, and she doesn’t. I’ve trained her multiple times using every single approach I can think of. She’s in a position that I need her to supervise a public service point during some evenings and every other weekend, so her not knowing how to do these basic things reflects poorly on me. I can’t rely on her, and it’s hurting the morale of the team. There are other interpersonal issues and her schedule is very limited, but this is the crux of the issue for me. 

I’ve given her verbal warnings, but I want to progress to something more formal to really get her attention because I don’t think she takes me seriously. But I’ve only ever done one written warning ever, not at this job, and our employee manual doesn’t give any advice. I’d like to pick your brain since our HR is notoriously bad at responding in a timely manner. 

1. What is necessary for a written warning? 

2. We aren’t due for an eval yet. At her eval in May, I noted some areas of improvement. We’re not due for another one until late spring. Could I do a PIP unrelated to an official performance evaluation? 

3. When documenting things, what does HR look for in order to consider it documentation? Some of what I have are emails, meeting notes,  scheduled training sessions, and jotted down notes from counseling or observations I’ve made. I want to make sure I’m not missing anything I should have before I chat with HR hopefully next week. 

I’m hoping to still manage to turn this around, but after a year, I’m not hopeful. I want to make sure I’m prepared going into this. Thanks!

To start, I can count on one hand the number of days, weekends included, when I didn’t work in the past six months. My supervisor is very supportive in team meetings with an audience, and maybe she actually is for my coworkers. I asked for help, expecting her to review my workload with me, offer advice, anything really. Instead, she said I was “doing it to myself” (I received no further explanation) and addressed it like a performance issue. This has occurred on three separate occasions. 

I also have a chronic illness, which I had been managing well. Over-exertion can trigger a flare up, and my doctor suggested PTO for a couple of days to rest. For the record, I have not taken a single day of PTO in over a year due to my workload. 

I mentioned submitting a PTO request (with the proper notice) on a Thursday and I explicitly mentioned why I had the need for it. She only said “okay.” The following Monday during our team meeting, she included in the agenda and discussion that it’s inappropriate to take PTO right now during “critical times.” There is nothing critical about now or the time I requested, except that it’s fairly critical for me. 

The next day, as usual, I started my day at 7am (official work start time is 8:30am) to meet my deadlines. She attended all of my calls for their entirety (unusual), and she called me several times to accuse me of mistakes I did not make and to inform me a client is mad at me. She sounded happy when telling me this, which is also extremely unusual. It’s also unusual for this client to ever be unhappy with me, and we had just had an hour long call that was completely normal. 

At 5:30pm, she called me again. I still had maybe an hour and a half to two hours left of work to complete due to the chronic disruptions. She instructed me to go to a site thirty minutes away to work on a project that would last past midnight. 

I tried. I didn’t make it out of the house. I ended up needing medical attention. Now I’m on medical leave, and short term disability won’t cover my bills. I’ve been trying to avoid this, and she went from ignoring my pleas for help to actively worsening my work conditions until I broke. 

I saw the term “constructive discharge” - is this what she may be attempting to do? 

Can anyone offer any advice? I have no idea what to do here. 😞 Apologies if any important details are missing - I’m just exhausted. Happy to answer any clarifying questions and am grateful for any help.

A year or so ago I was out at a work happy hour with my manager (f/40s) and some other teammates.  Some personal conversations came up about family and kids and my manager, who is single with no kids,  made the following statement: ""I don't like to be around any kids if I can't lay hands on them."". Not thinking she was serious, I asked if she was kidding.  She replied: ""no, like, if I don't have the authority to physically punish a child I don't like being around children.""

I later told my husband this exchange, but as it wasn't really work related I didn't see a need to tell anyone at work about it.  It just changed my feelings towards my manager. 

Cut to today, where earlier in my weekly 1-1 with this same manager, I brought up having been called for jury duty for the first time.  To which she said, ""yeah whenever I get called for jury duty I tell them I'm a crazy racist, not that that works."" And while I know this statement might have been in jest, it has really stuck with me today. 

I'm feeling really conflicted about saying anything but both of these situations have made me extremely uncomfortable.  Our team is small and I worry that if I reported it to our ethics line or HR that she would know it was me who said something.

The other parts of the agreement are generally about the time I worked at the company, for example I will keep information confidential and I won't sue the company about anything that happened during my employment.  But I don't see anything in the following clause which restricts my ability to cooperate in a lawsuit which is unrelated to my employment.  For example, if ten years in the future I become aware of illegal action by this company, it seems unreasonable that I wouldn't be able to share that knowledge with an attorney because I happened to work for the company a decade before.  Is there an implicit scope that I'm missing?

> No Cooperation. Other than in connection with filing a charge or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or other comparable federal, state, or local agency, or under a valid subpoena or court order to do so, or otherwise as permitted by applicable law, you will not counsel or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any disputes, differences, grievances, claims, charges, or complaints by any third party against the Company or any Released Party. For attorneys, nothing in this Section (No Cooperation) will restrict or limit your right to practice law or represent future clients, as described in the state bar rules of professional conduct of the state in which you are licensed to practice law (“the Rules”); provided, however, that you must honor all of your other continuing ethical obligations to the Company and the Released Parties under the Rules, including as to client confidentiality and privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consistent with applicable law, nothing in this Agreement prevents you from disclosing the facts or circumstances underlying your claim or action for sexual assault, sexual harassment, workplace harassment or discrimination, the failure to prevent workplace harassment or discrimination, or retaliation for reporting or opposing harassment or discrimination.

Yet the following section, regarding cooperation with the company is limited to suits involving my work at the company:

> Cooperation with the Company. You agree to cooperate with the Company regarding any pending or subsequently filed internal investigations, litigation, claims, or other disputes or legal proceedings involving the Company that relate to matters within your knowledge or responsibility during your employment with the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree: (a) to meet with the Company’s representatives, its counsel, or other designees at reasonable times and places; (b) to provide truthful testimony to any court, agency, or other adjudicatory body; and (c) to provide the Company with notice of contact by any adverse party or such adverse party’s representative except as may be required by law. The Company will reimburse you for your time at a reasonable hourly rate and other reasonable expenses in connection with the cooperation described in this Section.

I've looked at a [sample contract](https://www.contractscounsel.com/t/us/separation-agreement-and-release) and a few SEC 8-K filings with similar language, none of which seem to limit this no-cooperation scope to matters which occurred during the employee's tenure.

The company is going through tough times after losing a major client, and my department has been impacted.

When I first joined 4 years ago, my department was great, with supportive colleagues and amazing managers. I was promoted to my current role 2.5 years ago and was told I’d be trained for a Senior Digital Marketing Manager position within 2 years. I’ve expressed my interest in a promotion and have taken steps to prove my readiness, including managing small campaigns and providing relief to senior managers.

However, after 2 years, no promotion or raise came. To make matters worse, a coworker in the same position is actively being trained for a senior role. Feeling overlooked, I stopped going above and beyond and focused on my current duties.

In January 2025, two senior managers and a junior team member resigned, and I saw this as an opportunity to step up. But instead of promoting from within, the company hired four outsourced employees in India who will work remotely for $500/month. One of these employees was assigned to assist me, but I was told I’d be responsible for training them on my own job duties. I worried that once the outsourcing employee was fully trained, my position might be at risk.

As I trained this employee, I noticed my workload increasing significantly. Even with help, I’ve had to work late into the evenings and weekends. My tasks have become overwhelming, leading to mistakes, constant clarification requests from senior managers, and delays in campaign launches. I’ve also taken 12 sick days this year, well beyond my usual 5, because I’m feeling mentally and physically exhausted.

Despite raising concerns with my director about the lack of support and the need for more staff, she insists we are fully staffed. She also said my work ethic has slowed and I need to ""step it up"" to get a promotion. When I mentioned I haven’t had a raise or promotion in two years, she responded that I need to prove I’m ready, and then she can ""fight"" for me. She even suggested I look for other opportunities, offering to provide a reference.

I finally took a much-needed 2-week vacation in October, and upon my return, I was told the client had complained about my slow responses and that I often need clarification on marketing campaigns. My director said the client feels I’m not fit to manage their campaigns for 2026. My director proposed I manage a smaller client on my own, essentially giving me the responsibility of a senior manager but without the title or pay. Again, she insisted that I can watch for other opportunities & she’d happy to provide a reference.

During the conversation, I finally told her that if she wanted me to resign, she should just be honest with me. She seemed surprised but reassured me that she didn’t want me to leave. She promised to discuss my situation with upper management and would try to get me assigned to the smaller client.

At this point, I’m wondering: Is my director intentionally overloading me with work to push me to quit, or are they setting me up for termination?

I'm in an at-will state and would like to quit within days, but the document below that I seemingly signed sounds like I gave away my rights to quit.

Where I'm confused is:

1. When I signed the offer letter - it clearly had the paragraph that this is going to be an ""at-will employment"". This document must have gone through the signing process afterwards
2. Even this document mentions ""at-will"" in the very end, but with a caveat that ""subject to the applicable notice period"". Which is confusing - since at-will's core essence is my ability to quit at any time, so in my opinion it's self-contradicting...

Relevant part of the agreement:

xxxxx, including its subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies (hereinafter ""xxxxx"" or the ""Company""), believes that there are certain fundamental employment terms and conditions for certain employees (each a ""Covered Employee"") that are essential to protect the Company's business interests, client and employee relationships, and confidential information. These terms and conditions serve a number of important goals which, given your position with the Company, you will be uniquely positioned to advance. The goals include (i) promoting the continuity of our workforce, (ii) providing the Company, as well as the Company's employees, clients and customers, with a smooth transition of business, responsibilities, and business relationships in the event your employment with the Company terminates, (iii) ensuring that you fulfill your obligations to the Company during your employment, (iv) protecting xxxxx's confidential business information, trade secrets, customer lists and other proprietary information to which you will have access, and (V) maintaining xxxxx's customer and employee relationships and goodwill worldwide (collectively, the ""Business Interests"").

As a Covered Employee of xxxxx, you may be eligible to receive equity-based and other deferred incentive compensation awards under the Company's compensation plans (each a ""Deferred Incentive Compensation Award""), in the Company's sole discretion. Deferred Incentive Compensation Awards are granted to encourage continued employment, to protect the Company's global Business Interests, and to align the recipient's interests with the interests of the Company. In furtherance of these goals, and in addition to any eligibility requirements set forth in applicable equity or deferred incentive compensation plans, your eligibility for any Deferred Incentive Compensation Award that may be granted at any time, as well as your offer of employment with the Company, are conditioned upon your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including those set forth below in paragraphs A-D (the ""Terms and Conditions"").

A. Notice Period Prior to Termination

As a Covered Employee, you agree to provide xxxxx with notice prior to your resignation. Likewise xxxxx will provide you with notice prior to the termination of your employment (the ""Termination Date""), except in the event of a termination with  for Cause (1). These notice periods collectively are defined as ""Notice Period"" herein. Calculation of all Notice Periods will commence on the date you deliver notice of resignation, or receive notice of termination of your employment. The duration of Notice Periods vary based on your title at the time of the notice of the termination of your employment as follows:

• If you are a member of xxxxx's Management Committee at the time of the notice of the termination of your employment, your Notice Period will be 180

• If you are a Managing Director(2) at the time of the notice of the termination of your employment, your Notice Period will be 90 days;

• If you are an Executive Director(3) at the time of the notice of the termination of your employment, your Notice Period will be 60 days;

• If, at the time of the notice of termination of your employment, you are a Vice President in xxx, your Notice Period will be 30 days;

• If, at the time of the notice of termination of your employment, you are a Professional in xxx, your Notice Period will be 30 days;

• If, at the time of the notice of termination of your employment, you are a Vice President or Professional in xxx, your Notice Period will be 14 days.

1. Cause has the same definition as that contained in the most recent Deferred Incentive Compensation Award granted prior to the date of such termination. 2) References to Managing Director include equivalent title structures such as Executive Vice President in businesses covered by this Agreement. 3) References to Executive Director include equivalent title structures such as Senior Vice President in businesses covered by this Agreement.

During the Notice Period, you will remain an employee of xxxxx and will continue to be paid your base salary and be eligible for welfare and qualified retirement plan benefits applicable to you. However, you will generally not be eligible to receive Above Base Compensation (i.e., a bonus) if you resign your employment or the Company terminates your employment. If you give or receive notice of termination of your employment with the Company, please consult the Human Resources Department for more information.

As an employee during the Notice Period, you will be expected to continue to undertake such duties and responsibilities as are assigned to you by xxxxx, including duties to assist xxxxx with your transition from the Company and maintaining the Company's business, business relationships, and goodwill. In addition, as an employee you will continue to be bound by all fiduciary duties and obligations owed to xxxxx and required to comply with all Company policies and the Code of Conduct, as amended from time to time (the ""Code of Conduct""). The Company reserves the right to put you on paid leave (i.e., base salary and welfare and qualified retirement plan benefits continuance) and to suspend any of your duties and powers and to relocate your office for all or part of your Notice Period.

Subject to the applicable Notice Period that the Company has undertaken to provide to the extent required above, this Agreement does not create a contract for employment for any specified duration or in any way limit xxxxx's right to terminate your employment as an at-will employee or otherwise modify the Employment At Will Policy in the policy section of Employee Central (on the Company's intranet site). Nor does it alter your right to terminate your employment at will, subject to the applicable Notice Period.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oplzfm/ca_help_interpret_an_agreement_binding_me_to_60/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oplzfm/ca_help_interpret_an_agreement_binding_me_to_60/

I know normally qualifiers are  a loss of job or total loss of benefits but I have never even heard of an ICHRA till now and it seems like a total scam to the employees. 

Benefits is not my area,  any one that is a benefits guru know if that qualifies for special enrollment / open my benefits elections back up for my job so I can start coverage just for health only?

I’ve been working at my company for several years. Since the beginning, no one on our team is able to take lunch breaks.

AskHR,1op7y67,2025-11-05T16:44:34+00:00,1,1,Team recognition on tight budget [FL],"Spent seven months figuring out how to actually recognize my team when we have almost no budget for it. Managing people and constantly getting told great work matters but here's $200 total for the quarter and landed on something that works without feeling cheap

First attempt was using our company's official recognition program, sounds good on paper but approvals took 2 to 3 weeks so by the time someone got recognized the moment was completely dead. Also learned that trying to save money by doing quarterly recognition instead of monthly just made it feel like an afterthought

Took me some time to figure out I needed to nail three specific things. Timing: had to be immediate or at least same week. Amount: needed to feel real but not wasteful, landed on $25 per person monthly which lets me hit most of my team and delivery method mattered more than I thought, tried gift cards to specific stores and got complaints about limited options also tried prepaid visa cards but those have activation fees that eat into an already tight budget, read about some platforms and used hoppier because it handled distribution without extra fees and actually returned unused money which helps stretch the budget further

Being more intentional about when I gave recognition, instead of spreading it evenly makes a difference. I started doing spot recognition right after someone did something notable, closed a tough project, helped a teammate, solved a problem nobody else could figure out. That immediacy connected the recognition to the actual work and people started mentioning it positively. Still figuring out how to make this sustainable long term with limited budget but seeing actual impact on team morale makes it worth the effort. Curious what others have done with tight budgets for recognition that didn't feel like just going through the motions",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1op7y67/team_recognition_on_tight_budget_fl/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1op7y67/team_recognition_on_tight_budget_fl/

My offer letter clearly states at-will employment.  
There are two company documents on the intranet - one stating the employment is ""at-will"" and another (to me it's conflicting) - stating a notice is required or there will be legal penalties. There are other repercussions such as losing unvested shares and I'm aware of that.

To me the legal penalties for not giving notice seem bogus, if what I signed (offer) clearly states it's ""at-will"" then the company can't possibly charge me with any penalties. To my understanding the worst they can do is blacklist me from ever returning.

The question is - if the only document I ever remember signing that is the offer letter clearly states my employment is ""at-will"" then no matter what other documents exist (even if I signed them) - am I correct to assume I can just quit with no legal repercussions ?  
  
I am currently checking if there are any clawback rules, such as them having some way to force me to replay last year's bonus (would that even be legal?). I never signed anything regarding bonus payment and the bonus was paid in cash early every year.

The bonus and raise thing is harsh start a job let’s say November 2025 in a company that pays out bonus in April means you are not eligible April 2026 bonus or raise and have to wait till April 2027.

AskHR,1ooquha,2025-11-05T02:19:56+00:00,0,14,"[OR] No actual HR at my job, wondering how to handle this situation at work.","Hi! Sorry if this is the wrong place, but I'm at my wits end. Long story short, I work in the kitchen and there is a prep cook on Tuesdays when we're closed who doesn't do what needs to be done. I come in early on Wednesdays to get us set up but even then it's not enough. I have to spend like 45 min putting away everything they should have done on and then it makes me look bad like I can't get prep ready on time.

I started taking pictures of everything. What isn't being put away, what isn't being prepped (e.g. they will leave a prep list of like two to three things, but by the time I organize and start setting up, it's actually closer to 20 things needing to be prepped). This has been an ongoing issue that I have brought up to my Head Chef (will call HC from here on out).

It seems like HC isn't really addressing this other than straight up sending my messages to the cook. I have since stopped sending messages because I don't want to have a poor relationship with this cook, and I feel like my HC is only adding fuel to the fire by sharing our conversations with the cook.

I just received a text today from the cook that was passive aggressive, kind of actually aggressive, and not appropriate at all. I've owned a restaurant, I've been the AGM and GM at other restaurants, and if an employee showed this message to me I would immediately involve HR. I'm just at a loss right now on what to do. There is no proper HR, I don't feel like I can trust my immediate supervisor (HC) with keeping things confidential...I feel like my hands are tied and I can't say anything without receiving some type of backlash.

It's clear why they haven't been able to hold onto staff now because of this one employee...this cook has also dictated their own schedule after I was hired on. I was told I would be working certain days/shifts and then like a month and a half in they just wrote themselves into the schedule on my shifts with no pre-approval from management. I've never worked anywhere where an employee can straight up just decide with no conversation that they're now working ""x"" shift. This is wild to me.

I know the simplest and easiest answer is to just leave and find a new job. But I've been a big supporter of this place long before I worked here and I care about their success. Any help on how to proceed would be much appreciated! I just hate feeling like a snitch, but I can't tolerate the way this employee chooses to address me and the lack of accountability from management.

AskHR,1oop2cl,2025-11-05T00:59:11+00:00,6,35,Red Lobster Strikes again [IA],"Hey everyone,
I’m posting because I just got caught up in what looks like a massive layoff at Red Lobster today — and I honestly don’t even know what to do next.

I’ve been a salaried manager for several years and stuck through the bankruptcy earlier this year. I kept working through all of it — helping my team, keeping my store afloat, and doing everything asked of us. Once the company got bought out and Damola became CEO, things started changing fast.

Since then, it’s felt like one hardship after another. Our staffing hours were slashed, expectations and goals got more extreme, and the workload for managers became almost impossible. We still showed up, we still made it happen, and we still hit our targets.

Then they delayed our bonus payout — first time they said it was because of “cash flow” issues after offering an incentive program. We waited. The second time, our Q3 bonus (which we earned fair and square) was moved again — from October to December.

And today… instead of that bonus, they laid off what looks like between 250 and 500 salaried managers across the company — no notice, no warning, just “position eliminated due to lack of funds.” No payout for the bonus we already earned.

I was a full-time, salaried employee. I’ve gotten zero written notice, no severance, and no bonus payment.

What are my options here? Can I file something for unpaid wages or a WARN Act violation? Do I have any rights to my earned bonus since it was for work I already completed before termination?

Any advice or direction would really help. I know so many managers gave their all through the bankruptcy and after, and this feels beyond wrong.

Thanks in advance for any help or insight.

*edit forgot to add they now refuse to pay out my vacation time as well. 

* Edit: We are now receiving emails ( Severance Paperwork) the options given for reason of leaving says misconduct, voluntary dismissal and leaving for other employment. By filling this out with those options given we would not be able to receive unemployment. This keeps getting sketchier by the day. WE WERE LAID OFF, FORCED TO LEAVE OUR JOBS, I never had a PDR my entire career!! Please explain how I was let go because of misconduct?? That’s what automatically filled for me. Please explain this?

AskHR,1oom5lz,2025-11-04T22:55:38+00:00,0,17,[AZ] Maternity Leave Eligibility,"Hi! Generally speaking, how exactly does a 12 month eligibility requirement for parental leave work? By way of example, let’s say I start a new job on January 1 and I give birth that same year on December 1. Company policy says: (1) you have to be with the company for 12 months in order to be eligible for paid parental leave and (2) parental leave starts after short term disability is up (assume 6 weeks of STD paid at 80-100%).

Is the 12 month eligibility mark the day baby is born (i.e., Dec 1–thereby making me ineligible for paid parental leave)? OR is it the day after STD is up/the day you’d actually start getting paid under the company’s parental leave policy (which, in my example, would be roughly January 11)?

I’m interviewing for jobs that have pretty extensive and longer interview processes, but I’m also trying to plan an IVF transfer cycle… I’m a little older, so I don’t want to keep putting off the IVF transfer for job offers that may not even come! I’m leaning towards moving forward with IVF transfer as if I’m not considering switching jobs, but just want to understand how HR professionals think about parental leave eligibility.

I spoke to the hiring manager on Oct 28th and within the hour she immediately scheduled me for a final interview with a senior on the 29th.

It’s Nov 4th now. I haven’t heard anything. I sent them all thank you notes, via the agency recruiter. The agency recruiter said she’d let me know asap when she gets an update.

I can’t sleep at night. I’ve applied at this job about 3-4 times and they never looked at my resume until now. The culture there sounds amazing, the pay is 70% better than my current job. The bills are stacking up, and honestly I need a break. This is a big tech company, how soon should I expect to hear back?

The final interviewer kept talking in language where he inserted me into the position like “oh you’ll have no issues getting up to speed” “you’ll be working with so and so” and finally he said “I hope to see you around” before hanging up. It was a video call however he did not turn his camera on, which  thought was a bit odd.

Do I have any recourse to help them?,"I've managed an employee for several years at a local government agency in an at-will state, and her work directly supports our executive team. She's supported a half-dozen different executives now in her decade-long tenure. Solid work, stellar annual reviews, without exception. She's nearing retirement, upper 50s.

Our company recently hired a new CEO who has a personal beef with her based on decades-old drama that was apparently left unresolved. This new CEO immediately refused to work with her, but this was communicated to me as her manager only in a closed door meeting with no digital paper trail. I asked my own boss for an email outlining expectations and he declined, saying that was unnecessary and that I should be a team player, etc.

I was told to make her ""completely invisible,"" and that she is not allowed to be on emails (even cc'd), or to attend meetings. No change to job description, no change to salary, just boxed out with nothing to do. She is basically are now an underemployed consultant that I can assign random things to once in a while. She's *miserable,* and she feels dehumanized and humiliated. But she's not not in a financial position to leave. I'm also now doing both of our jobs, for no extra pay, and now I'm miserable and burnt out too.

My gut is they're trying to make her quit of her own volition and make the issue go away without anything on the record or having to pay any severance, etc. I've strongly advised her NOT to quit, to force the changes to be reflected on paper *somehow,* and to seek private counsel to see if there's anything she can do. Make them go on the record, I said. 

I don't know if she's sought private legal counsel, but I do know she went to our internal legal department, who were quite alarmed and called a series of confidential meetings with her and I, and they said this was likely actionable retaliation and exposes our agency to lawsuits and/or bad press. They pledged to investigate, but then the investigation was quickly and quietly closed with no comment, resolution, or paper trail. One of the lawyers just said to me, ""executive prerogative, sorry, time for her to move on.""

When my assistant supervisor Penny became my supervisor, she encouraged me to apply for the now open assistant position. Penny and I have worked in the same field for almost the same amount of time. I hadn’t really considered being in the role. But I started covering for her regularly and becoming more involved in tasks unrelated to my role. I covered the workload of our entire jurisdiction because it was just me for staff. We gained some students who I trained essentially by myself (5 people) all while managing my own separate duties. I also did separate training for this role. I completed the interview and received a generic email stating I was not the selected candidate. I followed up with the hiring manager and asked if there were issues with my interview and ways I could improve. 

The hiring manager replied to me about a week later over the phone. She said she was not sure what to tell me or what she is allowed to tell me. She said I passed the interview and they liked my interview. They checked in with my listed references which were penny and Karissa (previous supervisor). But then instead of using Danna as my 3rd listed reference they decided to chat with my manager Cheri. The hiring manager said that Cheri spoke to her boss and it was decided I wasn’t getting the job and she was not apart of the conversation. 

I asked what I was supposed to do now. She said to keep working on getting experience. I said I have worked here for 6 years have been doing the role already, and there are people who apply after a year with no supervisor training who get hired and do the training after getting the role. The hiring manager acknowledged that was true and apologized. 

My manager Cheri is not a fan of me. Our job revolves around people’s physical and emotional well being and there are times she has tried to make me put clients in unsafe situations and I challenge those decisions instead of going along with them blindly. 

At that point I was devastated. My manager blocked me from getting offered the job. My supervisor didn’t have my back. I felt like maybe my supervisor was stuck in the middle and tried my best to help her as our neighboring office had no supervisor and she had to cover both. I cover for her regularly doing her job several times a week. I do my best to help her when I can. 

All of this was upsetting. But today something else occurred. Penny sent an email to our office saying to reach out to Melissa for any help this afternoon (consults and assistance). Melissa is a coworker I have trained. She has been in this field for less than a year. She has never been in charge of anyone and is not familiar at the needed level with policies and procedures. 

I messaged penny and asked what was going on and she said Melissa wanted experience so she could apply for the assistant position. I said that was a slap in the face and upsetting to me. Penny said to apply for the position again and I said that Cheri prevented me from getting it last time so what would be different this time. Penny ignored the situation after that. Penny and Cheri tell me I am not allowed to vent to coworkers about things and that it creates a toxic work environment. But I feel so unappreciated and embarrassed all the time. I do vent to a trusted few people and they were outraged and upset on my behalf about all of this too. Penny knew this would hurt me and didn’t even have the decency to give me a heads up about it. 

I love my clients and wouldn’t want to leave them. But at this point, what are my options? I am embarrassed angry and disgusted with how I’m being treated. It’s looking like if Melissa applies for this position with less than a years experience, she could get it. After I’ve been here for 6 years, trained her and many other staff. Been covering supervisor regularly. Done the entire role. Etc. they typically don’t even let people cover without over a years worth of experience.

I apologize for the length, I just hope I provided enough relevent details.


Tl:dr- need to take all my PTO (3+ weeks Vacation time) at once to handle a serious personal matter that doesn't qualify for protected leave, getting pushback from management and now need Director and HR approval to proceed. While this is happening, I'm on the final steps (pending new employer's HR's final checks and approval) before starting a new job elsewhere and the timing will result in me giving my 2 weeks notice at some point during my leave (if approved). Seeking guidance on how to handle and work through these two matters.



Much to my displeasure, I have a couple different personal matters happening all at once, one of which if not dealt with properly and in a timely manner will have a great detrimental effect on me and my family. None of these issues, to my understanding, qualify for protected leave. To complicate things, I am actively being poached by another employer..


On Friday I reached out to one of the supervisors in my department to take all of my available vacation time. This supervisor is covering for my supervisor who had to step out on bereavement leave and additionally took vacation time on top of that to extend their time off. The start date I requested was the 17th, which on Friday was just over two weeks away and was well within the appropriate notice period for time off. They told me the touch base with them on Monday to discuss things further and expressed concerns over my request..

As directed, I reached out to them on Monday and they turned around and said granting my request would be very difficult for them to do and may even be considered an undue burden upon them because they would need to find coverage for me while I am gone. Additionally they also tried to say that because it is Monday, it is within the two week period before my leave is to start and they may deny it simply because I did not give them enough notice ignoring the fact that I reached out to them on Friday the moment I was aware that I needed this time off and that was before the two week cutoff they suddenly were referencing. (Upon looking in the employee handbook, there is no stipulation on when time may or may not be used, when or how it needs to be requested, nor how long it may be, just a catch all ""may be scheduled at the discretion of the facility in order to provide appropriate coverage"") I find this somewhat hypocritical because they have allowed many of my coworkers to take time off (even during PTO blackout periods) with as little as two days notice and would approve it on the spot regardless if coverage was needed or not.

The supervisor tried to dig into why I am taking this time off and I simply informed them that I have a number of things going on simultaneously at this moment but this time off request is specifically for one issue that is of great effect upon me and my family if not handled properly and as soon as possible. I also alluded to the fact that it is not a medical thing when they started to speak about protected leave.

While discussing the details of my coming leave they kept trying to confirm the information wrong or otherwise trying to instill limits ignoring what I was telling them. I was telling them I needed all of my available vacation time, which is a little over 3 and a half weeks, in one chunk and they kept trying to confirm it as two weeks or two weeks plus an additional yet to be decided amount 1-2 weeks after I return to work.

After much back and forth and many failed attempts to dissuade me in taking the time off, they turned around and said this request will have to be passed along to the director for our department and that I will have to speak with them before a decision can be made.

The supervisor kept trying to say that there would be an issue finding coverage for me while I am gone, which I find odd. There are two staff members on my team who are trained in the work I do and have been shown the intricacies of the areas I am responsible for and the supervisor knows this. One of them works with me on a near daily basis to assist me in my work and whenever I am out sick they are the one to step in and provide coverage. That same person also covered my areas while I was on vacation a couple times last year. We were discussing the matter in MY supervisor's office, who writes down all time off requests on the giant calendar behind their desk. No one has any time off requests, pending or approved, for the rest of this year so there'd be no issue retasking one of my teammates to handle my areas.

After checking around with some fellow coworkers in my department, it seems whenever the Director has an employee matter that needs their approval, they rope in HR and it always ends up a threeway call/meeting to discuss things before the employee is sent away and the Director and HR stay on to decide what to do. I've been warned that HR can be difficult to work with, to choose my words carefully, and act with caution when conversing with them. Our facility has a turnover problem yet in my time here it always sounds like it's a them problem and not an actual issue with the leaving employee.

As for the employment poaching I mentioned at the start. I was directly reached out to for a role in my field at my local municipality. The position is a union protected role, my current employer is not unionized. I was NOT looking for a job and had disabled/deleted most, if not all, of my job hunting accounts. So when they reached out I was surprised they had called me and, after vetting it on my end, we proceeded from there. I had passed all the interviews and was extended the offer to join pending HR's review (the standard background check, blood test, and physical), the job is mine assuming no issues during the final checks in the coming weeks. When I was hired by my current employer, they informed me that my experience netted me the top of thier payscale for the role and they have given me a 3-5% increase every year since. The new role is a 20% increase above my current pay and in 4 years that number jumps to 35%, and their current union contract indicates they get a 5% yearly raise. Because I was not looking for work, I did not handle the interview processes like I normally would. I was very candid with them and let them know as soon as I was aware that I would need time to handle my personal affairs before I can start with them, and they said that wouldn't be a problem and that they were willing to push off my start date until I finish handling my business (as long as I can do so before the end of december) . This is far more time and flexibility than what I'm asking from my current employer.

I am intent on taking the new role but am unsure of how to handle the transition given that I would effectively be giving my current employer notice while on leave..

Given that my request has been kicked up to the Director and HR, how can I best approach them in getting my request approved?

Once I start the process on my personal matter, I will not have the time nor mental bandwidth to handle anything else and there is the very real possibility that I will have to travel out of state to attend to matters in person. My personal issues is not covered under state or federal FMLA and I don't believe there are any other things that give job protection for someone that suddenly needs a large chunk of PTO (I doubt I'd qualify anyways). If I don't get approval then I dunno what I'll do but my performance will drop off a cliff until I get things resolved.

I also don't want to quit/put in my notice until I'm absolutely positive I'm good to go with the other job. I don't expect any issues or red flags to appear but I can't chance it due to how tight finances are at this time. I'm not sure I can say I have a personal emergency yet, but if I don't handle things now and get it all squared away, it will become a serious emergency for my entire family.

How do HR's normally handle employee emergencies and associated leave requests?

Is there anything I can say or do that will help my case in getting my PTO request approved?

I don't want to burn bridges with MY supervisor but I feel like if I pop by HR's office to give them my 2 weeks notice, they'll fire me since I'm already on leave and not on campus anyways.

Is there anyway I can smooth the transition from one employer to another?

AskHR,1onum5i,2025-11-04T01:37:13+00:00,3,24,"[Ct] Confrontation blew up, should I go to HR?","**TLDR:** I asked an engineer to close a safety door. He shouted at me for 10 minutes, went and shouted at my boss threatening to quit, and I was reprimanded by management who then bent safety rules to keep him happy. Now I'm worried about retaliation and wondering if I should notify HR.

I'm an engineer in my 30s who reluctantly leads the Safety Team (no real authority, just trying to promote a safer attitude). Workers regularly point out issues to me because of this. I’m not on a power trip; I just want to do a good job and leverage it in a performance review.

On Friday, a worker told me an engineer (let's call him ""Gus"") was running a machine with an easily closable safety door bypassed. The machine has large, dangerous moving parts, so this was a serious but easy fix. As it was minor I wanted to handle it quickly without going through all the paperwork, so I approached Gus and simply asked him to close it.

Gus **immediately exploded on me for 10 minutes**, ranting that employees have harassed him about this before and that closing the door costs too much lost production time. I tried to diffuse the situation, but he wouldn't stop, eventually challenging me to ""run it up to HR or management."" I was annoyed at this point as he had wasted so much time yelling, so I took a final dig and asked if there was a mechanism or procedure involved in closing the door that made it a hassle, his new engineer answered that it takes half a second to slide shut

On Monday, I was immediately called in. Gus had spent Friday afternoon **shouting at my boss and threatening to quit** (he even typed a resignation letter) because he felt ""harassed."" I was initially reprimanded for ""confronting"" him instead of going through my director.

Later, I was called into a meeting with **all the top leadership** (my manager, Operations Director, Sales Director, and Gus). In the meeting, **leadership basically bent the rules for him**: they confirmed he has ""special permission"" to run the machine unsafely and that I must never confront him. They did agree to get an outside contractor to say it's fine and put up warning cones for others. Gus gave a shorter tirade about being targeted, then shook my hand and told me not to ""make a scene in front of his trainee"" next time.

I know Gus has a documented past of blowing up at people (I found out through gossip after I stepped in it). My ego is bruised that my manager thinks I'm incapable of even talking to people, but more concerning is the vibe that they'll bend over backward to keep this guy happy. My friend/his trainee let me know Gus had been stewing over this all weekend.

Should I go to HR or should I let sleeping dogs lie? I don’t want to be the next concession to keeping him happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1onum5i/ct_confrontation_blew_up_should_i_go_to_hr/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1onum5i/ct_confrontation_blew_up_should_i_go_to_hr/

She agreed but had asked me to just find a cashier for the morning because she was coming in that day as a mid shift so I did. I called the cashier who is scheduled to work that night to see if he wanted to do a split shift and he agreed. A day later he tells me that he couldn't work that night because its his cousins wedding so I had informed the assistant manager about it and has also called in other cashiers at our store and at different stores to see if they wanted to come in and they said no so I had told him that he needed to inform the GM that he wouldnt be able to work that night. Mind you I had asked the assistant manager in front of the other SL and in front of a cashier if she would and she said yes and that she would talk to the GM about it.

AskHR,1onguj2,2025-11-03T16:46:06+00:00,1,4,[INDIA] Need advice: Weird experience with my reporting manager at my new company.,"24M Hey guys, I need some suggestions.

So this happened last Saturday. I recently joined a company as an Enterprise Sales Executive. My reporting manager is a BDM (Business Development Manager) whom I report to. Everything was going fine that day — we went out for lunch break. Usually, he smokes, but I don’t smoke at all. Then we’d usually come back, have lunch with other office colleagues, and get back to work.

But on Saturday, he told me to have lunch at a restaurant since he wanted to eat chicken, which isn’t allowed in our office. So we went, had lunch, discussed a lot of things, and laughed about various topics. Then he received a call from his reporting manager. After the call, he told me to go back to the office — he’d come in some time. (I think he got stressed and went for a smoke again.)

I went back to the office and started doing my work. He also arrived after some time and got back to his work. Then he got invited by his reporting manager. Meanwhile, I was sitting and waiting for him to come back because we also had our review meeting scheduled.

While waiting, one of my colleagues told me, “Let’s go down and have some snacks.” I went with him, we ate, and when I came back, I saw my sir sitting alone in a cabin. I went there and asked him, “Sir, should I bring my laptop for the review?”

He suddenly got really furious — asking where I had gone. He said, “I already told you we’re going to have our review meeting and you still went down? You just want to do whatever you feel like!”

I told him that I had informed the colleague I went with that my review meeting was soon and I’d be back quickly. That colleague told me, “Your sir won’t be free so soon.”

My manager said, “Oh, so he knows everything now? Should I ask him about everything then?” Then he added, “The one task I gave you isn’t even done yet. Just go and sit at your place.”

I was like, “What the hell just happened?” I was literally facing this kind of situation for the first time in my 4-year career.

After some time, he called me and asked how much work I’d completed. I showed him my work. He said, “Not like this, you should’ve done it that way.”
Meanwhile, he had been aware of what I was doing from the start, and I had also told him earlier that I wouldn’t be able to complete everything in one go — it would be in two parts. He had agreed to that earlier.

Then we got interrupted by his reporting manager, who asked about my performance. We had a discussion, and after his manager left, my manager said, “If my manager scolds me, then I’ll also scold you a little.”

I was like, WTF man! What’s wrong with this dude?

Now it’s Monday — I haven’t talked to anyone in the office.

So im 18F and hes 19M we have known each other for a while due to being in a martial arts club even we were 12 before we distanced apart, he dated my best friend when we were 16 and it ended in a really messy way, hes been to my house, I’ve been to his and once we confessed we liked each other only for me to back away when i realised he was a bit racist in the “i didn’t know it was racist” type way

I work in an airport cafe and he helps move people who have limited mobility, he soon started looking out for me according to my workers and constantly asking where i am. Where im going and if he could drop me home, each and every time ive said no but its gotten to the point where workers send me to the back just so im not seen by him because hes beginning to actually make it difficult for me to work when hes trying to talk to me every second or constantly looking for me, waving to me or just disturb me. I love where i work and i don’t want to leave it just because hes making me uncomfortable but ive even cried once or twice out of stress because he doesnt seem to get the hint to leave, help? What do i do?

Update: i have told my manager and she has put an end to it, i also told his manager as well and now they are looking at a plan of action, his managers own words being “we might have to fire him or possibly talk, it depends on how he goes about the new rule”
The new rule now being for him to linger he needs to buy something and cannot stay around for more than two minutes due to him having to do his own work.
Turns out he had been avoiding doing his job and sorta waiting on free times just so he could come up to the cafe we have. A bit uncomfortable knowing thats the situation but i feel better knowing that hes unable to come over anymore (also thank you so much to the people telling me how to actually go about this problem as i was scared and confused on how to before.)

They constantly gossip and they have the VP of sales, meanwhile VP of sales loves me so much, so thats the first drama,

Last year we didnt have a sales director so our VP of sales was leading us, and they even wanted to complain about him to HR, and they tried so many ways to tell me to join them to complain to HR about his strict way of leading, which I had no issues on. I said dont include me, i do have a kid to take care of. need this job.

this specific person in our team lets say X sHE is very toxic, with all fake smiles and laughs and want to be center of attention all the time, its unfortaunte that we have to work together under the same category and plan to the same sales call plan, so we have to work very closely together

I closed some strong sales deals this year and presented to leadership team, a month ago and everything started then, she couldnt handle it and she started giving me rolling eyes and attitudes in every topic we chat, also the 3 toxic others are her friends and they spread rumours that my wins for 2025 that i have presented are lies... and we have a Y person who does analytical support, for me and X. and this Y person is great at her work, but i later realized she carries words between us. but few months ago, i also mentioned few of my frustrations about this X girl

One day, there was a question coming from our team, and she was answering me rolling her eyes and with lots of ATTITUDE like ""offf"" , and I asked, ""hey is everything okay?""

Turns out she took my tone very aggresively and the other Y analyst person, also exagarrated this saying this was aggresive and they went to HR, HR didnt call me, it has been a month but i have heard from other people that, HR called every team member in our team to see if others also complain about me. Three team members who are on her side, but 3 others said great things about me..

HR asked our manager to mediate both of us and get to the bottom of it, this was truly exaggareted even if she has taken aggresively , she could have told me that straight up rather than escalating to HR. but she just want me to fail. i mentioned all this to my leadershup team, and Y and X has also done some other gossipy actions earlier that leadershup team was aware. but I am really curious why HR is NOT calling me to hear my side of story? I asked the management my director and VP that if she went to HR but they said no, but i know for a 100% fact that she went to HR.

Why the manager who trusts me is hiding this? I am worried now that all my reputation is going to go downhill becuase of these two bitches who are digging my hole and why HR havent called me in for a discussion, I do have so many other examples what toxiicity they have done I want to share , not sure if i should go to HR without even being called, or should I just worry about my role now that HR didnt call me and this wont end and its on going investigation? i was never complained to HR before and going through this toxicity first time, the actual "" si everyhing okay?"" question that I asked happened on Sept 29, mean while everyone in the company is filled with the gossips these 3 women are spreading about me. and some of my allies saying, I need to defend myself!

My role then changed significantly and my responsibilities doubled as there were redundancies made within the team and I took on everybody else’s workload with some pay increase agreed too. The expectations also changed in terms of visibility and delivery as the business was going through a transition period following an acquisition. None of this was communicated about what is expected moving forwards. 6 months down the line my line manager informed me that I am now put in a PIP for not delivering the expected. I was genuinely shocked about this and when challenged the decision I was told there was informal performance discussions with me where in fact there was none of that, just our normal 1-2-1s, I tried challenging it back saying that I cannot see how I am performing on year one very well as my first year review was excellent and now all of a sudden I’m exactly on the opposite side where a PIP is needed. The objectives on the PIP were very subjective i.e. communication to be improved, participation in X project, there wasn’t really anything tangible or measurable there and there still isn’t. HR has only been involved in one out of three discussions so far. I have highlighted the fact that I cannot be put on PIP and be provided with absolutely no support at all, I have requested some additional support and training and nothing has been arranged so far and it’s been 4 months since the PIP started. I feel like I am being pushed out and I did say this openly during one of the conversations and obviously the response was that we just want to align you with the job expectations. My final PIP review meeting is in the next few days and I have strong suspicions that we will not agree on the outcome and they will make me fail it, they have already put the objectives as off track from the previous review meeting despite clear evidence being presented from my side and action being taken. I have got some interviews already lined up as I am looking for a new role, is it better for me to resign or propose a settlement agreement prior to the final PIP meeting happening? And if that's the way forwards, how do I propose this? Or just wait and see what happens on the day? What I want to avoid is to have a bad reference on my records for a future job.

Forgot to mention that I needed to take some time off as holidays and then work remotely for an additional two weeks which has never been a problem as my contract says home-based and remote working as primary location and they forced me to take unpaid leave instead. While I was away as soon as I came back I saw a job advert for my own role advertised!

Hey everyone, I really need some help figuring out what to do here. I got another offer from a new company in June 2025.

Based on that, I joined my new company on June 23. However, I recently discovered that my last working day is still marked as July 28 in my current company’s system. Because of that, I ended up receiving my June salary from them too — which created a PF overlap for June and part of July. Now my new company has sent me a show-cause notice mentioning that I might face termination if the issue isn’t resolved. To make things worse, my previous company isn’t helping fix this even though this happened because they didn’t update my last working day correctly. Has anyone faced something like this before — PF overlap or dual employment due to exit process delay?

AskHR,1olg91w,2025-11-01T05:44:39+00:00,1,1,Seeking Advice on How to Avoid Retaliation for Filing Complaint Againts Toxic Manager. [CAN-AB],"Hi all, I apologize if this isn't the right place or way to go about this post, typically I only use this app recreationally but due to the severity or my current workplace stress, I felt the need to reach out in search of some advice with the following.

I’m looking for information on how best to move forward with filing a formal complaint about ongoing management issues at my workplace in Alberta. For over two years, my manager has created a hostile environment — openly admitting to racially biased hiring, making discriminatory remarks, and retaliating against staff who call in sick or request time off. She has cut hours, ignored religious and rest-day requests, and regularly threatens or yells at staff and customers.
Previous attempts to raise these concerns weren't investigated and swiftly dismissed, despite a history of similar conduct from this manager in previous locations, leading to retaliation and worsened treatment. I’ve now documented everything through emails and a recorded HR call, with multiple current and former staff willing to provide statements. I plan to leave soon but want to ensure this is handled properly and safely, both for myself and my coworkers who fear speaking out.
HR and a new upper manager have agreed to speak with me next week. Given the history of retaliation and lack of accountability, what’s the best and safest way to proceed with this complaint so it’s actually taken seriously?

I am off shift for the next 2 days, my new upper manager contacting me back saying they will plan a day to speak with me next week. Any advice or information on how to proceed will be greatly appreciated and I will attempt to get back to any questions that may come up. Thank you.

She lives out of state now, or I would have been there already as I have helped her with both previous pregnancies, labor/delivery and aftercare. Her Doctor said that she is going to need someone there to help her as she will not be able to tend to the newborn alone, care for herself in excess of getting to the bathroom alone, or care for her toddler. I am going to go and help do what I can, but am limited on the time I have available to me. We had the doctor fill out FMLA paperwork ""in loco parentis"" of her and the children as I will need to be there to get them to DRs appointments, cook, clean, grocery shop etc. Her husband is only allowed to take 7 days off at his job or the rest is unpaid and they simply cannot afford that. I will likely be helping a bit in that manner for a bit as well. By the time I get there, he will be going back to work. He works long shift work and is unavailable/out of service while on the job, and she and the kiddos will still need help. I did not leave last night when she went in to an emergency induction, as my HR still had not reviewed the FMLA paperwork that was submitted early last week. Today, I got an email saying that my FMLA was denied, but she said that if I submit other information or documents she can review it again. I feel that it is important to note that both myself and my sister are in fact estranged from our parents and have had no relations with them in many years. I was my sisters regular care giver growing up, even as I was only 5 years older, until I was moved to foster care. My sister left the home shortly after turning 15 and didn't look back. We have always helped each other in this manner and nurture each others children as our own. I would like to have the ability to do so again, especially since she is in such great need of it. I am covered to use any of my time available as Earned Sick and Safe time under MN state statute, as HR told me, but I am only protected if I go into ""no-pay"" if I am on qualifying FMLA leave. I only have about 6 days of leave currently, so I could really use this protection. Can anyone tell me what I need to prove/establish in loco parentis in this situation?

AskHR,1ol4f04,2025-10-31T19:49:20+00:00,18,12,[OK] Should I reach out at end of 30-Day PIP?,"Sparing a lot of details, I was placed on a 30-day PIP that required me to send a daily report email to my supervisors at the end of each workday. The PIP also stated there would be evaluation reviews at the 10-day checkpoint, 20-day checkpoint, and a final full review on Day 30.

On Day 10, I waited for my supervisors to arrive for the 10-day review, as they had stated these would be conducted in person. After a couple of hours with no sign of them at the office, I reached out to one of them to ask if we would still be meeting that day. About 15 minutes later, I received a response saying no, the other supervisor would be down one day the following week, and we could just discuss it then. Okay, fine. Whatever. The 10-day review ultimately happened on Day 12, when that supervisor happened to already be in the office for another reason.

When Day 20 rolled around, nothing happened. No one showed up to meet with me, no one reached out about scheduling a review, and no one responded to any of my daily report emails. Radio silence. Maybe I should have reached out to ask what the plan was, but I didn’t, and nothing ever came of it.

Fast forward to today, Day 30, and I still haven’t heard anything regarding a meeting or final evaluation. I’ve continued to send my daily report emails every single day, exactly as required in the PIP.

Now I'm left with this dilemma: should I reach out and ask if we’re meeting for a final review? Should I wait for them to initiate it? And if I don’t hear anything, am I justified in stopping the daily report emails now that the 30 days are up?

So I recently applied for a central office position with a school system doing IEP compliance management — basically making sure everything related to special education documentation, timelines, and implementation is being done properly. It’s literally my dream job.

I’ve already made it through the phone screening and the performance task (I turned in an 8-page write-up for that), and I just found out that I made it to the final interview round this Monday. From what I can tell, it’s going to be a panel interview with four people, and I think there’s only one other candidate they’re looking at.

Now I’m starting to spiral a little bit. I keep wondering — is this panel interview more of a “vibe check” to see if I fit the team culture, or are they still heavily testing knowledge and performance? I don’t want to underprepare or overprepare.

If anyone’s been through a similar process (especially in school systems or compliance/IEP management roles), what should I expect? What kinds of questions do panels usually ask at this stage?

I work at one of the FAANG companies in a technical role (not finance or leadership).

Earlier this year I accidentally bought a single call option on company stock before realizing it wasn’t allowed. I immediately reported it to compliance, took the training, and let the option expire worthless.

A few days ago, right before earnings, I sold about $50K worth of RSUs. Normally my role isn’t restricted and people around me can sell anytime, but I just realized that after the first violation I was likely added to the “trading window” list. I honestly didn’t know that restriction would apply to me permanently.

Both times there was no profit, and I’ve never had access to any non-public financial info. I’m planning to self-report again, but I’m worried about what happens next.

If anyone here works in HR, compliance, or employee relations, what usually happens in cases like this?

I’ve been working as an Office Manager at a new company since June. We have a tea lady who takes care of refreshments for executives and guests, and keeps the kitchen organized. She’s always been lovely to work with.

Recently, she’s had to take several sick days and time off, which meant I had to take over most of her responsibilities — on top of my regular workload. The first few times, I didn’t mind, but as it became more frequent, it started affecting my ability to keep up with my core tasks.

So, I contacted HR and asked if they could assign one of their tea ladies temporarily to help cover during her absence. I saw it as the same as when any other staff member takes PTO and someone fills in temporarily. HR agreed, and it helped a lot.

However, I have a feeling the tea lady may have taken offense, thinking I was trying to replace her — which absolutely wasn’t my intention. I only wanted some help to keep things running smoothly.

Do you feel my concerns are precedented, or am I just fatigued?","Earlier this year, due to several people at the company leaving we made some quick decisions to hire new employees. We were willing to give this person a solid chance, although my boss and I agreed that it is possible that it may be more difficult to train them. Now that they’ve worked for 5 months and passed the probationary period, there’s an issue with them what feels like every other day, and when they get informed that there is an issue they will cry, no matter how kindly it is put. They do learn from and adjust, but they are unfortunately lacking in several areas and something new always crops up. These issues include a bad attitude, negative talk and constant complaints about clients which create a really bad vibe in the work environment, sensitivity which creates unreliability because you need to have thicker skin in our work environment in order for us to think you’re ready for anything bigger than the most basic tasks, and other things I haven’t even told my boss including willfully not obeying my instructions, not being a team player, and expecting the other person in joint work to always take the lead. 

I’m in a very small office and I’m in the position that if I did speak up about how I’m not sure if they will work, I could very likely have them subject to more scrutiny by the boss or possibly even let go.

AskHR,1okkxk9,2025-10-31T04:05:00+00:00,0,6,Should I report??? [PA],"Hello, I (f25) started working at a non-profit organization as a social media person earlier this year. Our team is relatively small, with many employees juggling multiple positions at once, and everybody interacts with one another in-person quite frequently.

My main concern is we have a facilities guy (let’s call him Ned) who gave me MAJOR creeps since day one. He is an older man, maybe late fifties or sixties. My very first interaction with him, he started off by “warning” be to be wary of another mystery employee that I had never met, because according to him, that guy was a “major creep who preyed on women like me.” This definitely weirded me out, but I sort of wrote it off as this is just how his generation talks. Since then, Ned does a lot around our organization and everybody except me seems to like him a lot. He’s always cracking stupid “ex-wife” jokes that make me want to slam my head in a door. Not illegal, just terrible. He frequently hangs closely with another woman my age, who does not seem weirded out by him at all. They laugh and joke all the time. But I get super bad vibes from him. I’ve been feeling like he waits for moments when I’m alone, then insists on hanging around talking to me. Every room I walk into where he’s at, he has to privately wave at me. If he exits the room from talking with someone else, he always softly says goodbye to me. Again, not illegal, just veeeerrry uncomfortable. I try to avoid him, try not to engage, but he doesn’t seem to pick up on that as a sign to leave me alone.

Recently I can’t help but feel like he’s been covertly trying to obtain my phone number. In this workplace, a lot of us are running about most of the day, and while not obligated to use text, many of us do for convenience. I share my number with others, but I’m not comfortable sharing with him. Several times already, he’s walked up to me talking about work, and off-handedly goes “oh, by the way, do you have my number?” I say, “you’re welcome to write it down and leave it on my desk,” but I give no indication that I intend to put it in my phone. Today he came up to my desk and said he needed a marketing “favor” from me. He explained that he needed a short video clip of a sign he put up, to send to the boss to prove that he did it. I don’t feel he actually needed me for this, but since video editing is technically my department, I obliged. I created the video for him and he asked me to text it to him to pass along to the boss. I told him I’d save him the trouble by sending it to the boss myself, which I did. A little later in that day, he stops me at the microwave and goes “oh, btw, this other coworker would also like that video. He just *loves* stuff like that. Think you could send me that video?” This felt like a thinly- veiled lie if I ever heard one. So again I said “no trouble, I’ll just email it to that coworker and include you both in the thread,” which is what I did.

None of these instances outright look like harassment. He never specifically asked for my number, nor demanded I give it. It just really, really, feels like he’s trying to covertly coax it out of me. I want to ask my employers to intervene, but I don’t know how to prove this as more than just paranoia. They all seem to love him. This evening I looked up this man and he has a criminal history (relating to finances and scamming). My organization will hire some people despite criminal history, depending on the severity of the crime. Surely they must’ve looked into his background and decided to hire him anyway?

I apologize for the long story. I just don’t know how to proceed and I feel very uncomfortable every time I’m forced to interact with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1okkxk9/should_i_report_pa/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1okkxk9/should_i_report_pa/

Additional context - he learned about a 90 day probation and in office 5 days a week policy for the first 90 days (although not in any handbooks) after the position was told to him they do flexible work schedule and 3 days in office a week.

AskHR,1okfpy7,2025-10-30T23:55:03+00:00,1,2,True-up wage system: is it legit? [OR],"My question is about itemized paychecks. My paystubs show an hourly wage line and an ""adjustment"" line that is not itemized.

I started with a new company and am in my first 90 days. The company is small, employees in single digits. We're therapists, and it's a group practice owned by one of the therapists. The way we are paid is a combination of hourly and fee split: We clock in an out as hourly employees, but then for the hours when we see clients, we receive a fee split from that client's insurance or payment, minus the hourly wage.

For example: let's say I worked 2 hours, at $20/hr. During one of those hours, I saw a client, and our practice billed their insurance and received a $100 payment. The practice would then pay me 60% of that reimbursement ($60) MINUS the $40 they'd already paid me for the day. So, in total, I'd be paid $60 for the day: $20/hr x2 hrs = $40, plus the $60-$40=$20.

My employer doesn't itemize the split on my paychecks, just lists it as an ""adjustment"" in addition to the hourly pay. My employer characterizes this as a ""true up"" and advised me it won't be itemized.

BOLI says this is technically legal, but doesn't conform with the guidelines to itemize.

The severance package included a small cash amount + extension of stock options exercise window till Dec-2025. The deadline was 45 days after they gave the severance package.

My company is going through a restructuring and in that restructuring, my HR manager was let go. We are now looking for another HR generalist to help with all the work. Right now, it is just my HR generalist and me.

I am so overwhelmed. Not only am I going to school, but we have triple the work since our HR Manager was let go.

AskHR,1ojtllh,2025-10-30T07:49:58+00:00,0,5,[MD] Am I being bullied?,"I work as an advisor for a university and my job is student facing. My job involves calling students, helping them plan for future classes, and meeting with them in addition to planning with colleagues, contributing ideas etc. 

I’m not quiet when it comes to students, meetings, or situations where participation is expected or suggested. I’ve been commended multiple times for contributing, asking thoughtful questions, and presenting. These are the same groups where most people are too shy to speak up or don’t speak up but will message me thanking me for asking or bringing up certain topics.

But ever since I started this job, my coworkers have constantly commented on how “quiet” I am. It’s been going on weekly for about three months now. It never fails. Someone will make a sarcastic comment like, “Well nice talking with you,” or “Stop talking, you’re giving me a headache,” as a joke about how little I talk. 

The thing is, these comments usually happen when they’re chatting casually about non-work topics. I don’t interject because it’s not really a conversation that needs me in it. If someone is having a one on one conversation I don’t feel it’s necessary to add my two cents. If it’s a group discussion or something work-related, I participate when I have things to and I always give ideas or my thoughts if I have them. 

What makes it worse is that people say these things publicly, in front of the office, always, and I end up being the butt of the joke. I’ve explained that I’m just more introverted. That I contribute when I have something to contribute. That I am just focused on my work. I am not rude to anyone. I get compliments from students on my professionalism and kindness and work ethic. I brought my coworkers gifts as a thank you when they trained me. I ask how they are, I do the small talk that’s appropriate. I just don’t feel the need to chatter about everything all the time, that’s not me and no one has ever complained about this at any other job. Quite the opposite.

I’m honestly exhausted. I like my job, but I’m tired of having my personality dissected every week. It comes from my coworkers, my supervisor, the only person who hasn’t said anything is the directors but they don’t work in the office with me, and another employee who works in my office but is best friends with another coworker. 

I can’t really confide in anyone because they all gossip and talk to each other constantly but I wish I could. I chat with people on teams and I’m talkative when it’s appropriate. It’s like I am expected to just open my mouth and say whatever I’m thinking about random stuff and I cannot. I don’t. That’s not me. I’ve explained myself once and I don’t know why I’m expected to keep doing so. It’s getting exhausting, I feel like I’m being made a joke, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is bullying or if it’s just disregard?

AskHR,1ojozh8,2025-10-30T03:12:28+00:00,9,18,[PA] HR reviewing my background check after 3 weeks on the job. What does this usually mean?,"I’d really appreciate some insight on this situation.

I started a new job almost a month ago. After getting a conditional offer, I completed the background check paperwork and disclosed a past conviction. It’s not violent, sexual, or drug-related, and the job isn’t in anything that requires a squeaky clean past like healthcare, childcare, or finance. I’ve always disclosed it for past jobs, and while it sometimes comes up, it’s never prevented me from being hired as long as I disclosed it from the start.

This time seemed no different. I disclosed everything, my background check was submitted, and a few days later I was contacted to start onboarding. Since then, I’ve traveled for training, been on the job, received paychecks, and enrolled in benefits.

The only mention came in my second week when my boss called to ask if I had disclosed my record. I confirmed what I had written, and she later called back to say everything was fine. My boss and trainer have both told me I’m doing great and that they’re happy to have me on the team.

Now, three weeks in, I’ve received an email from HR saying that I may not be hirable because of my record. They’ve asked me to submit references, letters of recommendation, and other supporting documentation within 10 days. After that, they’ll make a decision. 

Naturally, I’m stressed. I turned down other offers for this role, and I’ve already been fully onboarded. I’m frustrated because if this was going to be a problem, I wish it would’ve been addressed before I started. It feels like someone may have missed a step during the pre-hire process, and now I’m the one at risk of losing my job.

I’m pulling together everything they asked for, but I’d love some perspective from an HR standpoint:

How common is it for background checks to trigger a post-hire review like this, especially when all the information matches?

Is this typically just part of a compliance process, or is it usually a bad sign? I’ve never been asked to submit anything like this before and it’s not like it’s a different job or industry than what I’ve held before. 

If I disclosed everything upfront and have been performing well, how much of a chance do I realistically have of keeping my job?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

AskHR,1ojoj0g,2025-10-30T02:49:33+00:00,0,6,High-Risk Banking Offer: Pre-Emptive Disclosure Strategy for Poor Credit/Income Gap? (Business Banking/Commercial RM Role) [IL] [WI],"Seeking advice from HR, Compliance, or experienced hiring managers, particularly those in regulated industries like finance/banking. I am at a critical juncture and need feedback on a high-risk strategy. 

Background: 

• Role: Commercial Relationship Manager (Mid-Market). 

• Industry: Regulated Regional Commercial Bank (Bank A). 

• Compensation: Verbally agreed-upon Target Total Cash Comp (TCC) of $175K. 

• Status: I am the top candidate. The Hiring Manager (HM) and executive boss have given strong signals, and the written offer is imminent this week. When the HM spoke to my former colleague that referred me after my second round interview, he told her ""I was polished and crushed it"". 

The Problem (The Risk): I anticipate a contingent offer that will require a background/credit check (standard for the industry). My compliance risk factors are severe: 

1 Credit Score: Currently in the mid-400s (due to mass layoff and failed startup launch). Several accounts are in default. 

2 Income Verification: I have a significant gap in W2/1099 income as I was involved in a start-up (post-layoff). The owner of the business was a former client and ask me to help him build the business out/scale it. There was a back and forth about bringing me on via W2 or 1099, and when the latter was offered, I made the mistake of thinking I'll sort that out later. There is a paper trail of payments via Zelle, personal check, Apple Pay, and possibly PayPal. He always offered and will be willing to do a verbal verification of employment (IE the background check company reaches him directly once it doesn't show a record as for W2 or 1099). I should've been more assertive here, but the plan for bringing me on in a formal manner was never properly executed. The original plan was for him to quit his W2 job and solely focus on the business ($1.5M in revenue in AV/IT) as of January 2025, but that timeline kept getting pushed back. He waffled with that and with some of the strategic initiatives I was rolling out. He will (per my last convo with him), probably quit current job in January 2026. I decided to stick out the startup because it gave me the opportunity to work on cool stuff like building out sales processes and strategy (I came up with the idea of rolling out AVaaS, which we are about to roll out). It also gave me the flexibility to work out some personal matters, as I valued healing instead of taking a job at a competitor I could've gotten in April/May 2024 at pay rate higher than the job that laid me off (and most of your division). I don't regret working the startup, what I learned was invaluable (I even self taught myself more about the industry and even landed a distributor/supplier for us organically on my own). This entrepreneurial approach to business is something I spoke on during the interview process and made me more attractive. My previous job was a similar role for a major national bank, and I passed background check with a score in the high 500s and low 600s. 

My Strategic Dilemma: I fear my offer will be pulled automatically if Compliance discovers the 400s score cold. I have executive support (the HM wants me). 

My Proposed Mitigation Strategy (Need Feedback): My plan is to NOT sign the contingent offer immediately, but instead: 

1 Secure the written offer and accept it contingent on the check. 

2 IMMEDIATELY call the Recruiter/HR (before the check is initiated). 

3 Execute Pre-Emptive Disclosure: Explain the situation using an accountable narrative, tying the defaults and income gap directly to the mass layoff and the launch-phase instability of my venture. 

4 Present a Plan of Action (POA): Commit to a formal, immediate repayment schedule/consolidation using the new salary, and offer to provide monthly status updates to HR/Compliance. 

The Question for Experienced Professionals: 

1 Is this Pre-Emptive Disclosure strategy viable? Is bringing the HR rep into the loop before the check the only way to seek a Compliance exception? Is it best to wait until it comes up? Should I wait until after the offer is accepted but before the background check and explain to the background company. I've heard a mixed bag. I was thinking about waiting until it comes up as my layoff was 18 months ago, the beginning of a mass wave of layoffs across industries where this scenario is becoming more commonplace. 

2 In your experience, what is the likelihood of a Compliance waiver/exception being granted for a high-value candidate (with executive sponsorship) when the default/debt is tied to a documented professional/economic dislocation, provided a clear POA is established? 

Any non-judgmental, practical feedback from professionals in HR or regulated industries would be invaluable.

This can be a long story since I want to be very transparent with what happened with me..
So I joined this social media internship at the end of September.
Nothing really bad has happened with me tbh but it's really very confusing for me.
We had a small diwali party day before choti diwali and I went to the party, it was nice and I also got diwali gifts from them. 
Then on the next day one of my main boss acted a bit weird. I'm just writing this in whatever way it is coming in my mind cuz idk how to frame it properly.
So basically I was dressed a bit over though I was just wearing a suit but then also I was dressed over as I was also wearing heavy jhumkas, bangles, blingy heels and I also putted on some shimmering makeup on me because this is what I love the most to do and every else was in their simple ethnic attire not makeup and no accesories except one other employee. I also recorded some videos of diwali pooja and clicked some funny pictures of my other colleagues and some good one as well. So the next day my boss sent a message to me saying hello, please send the diwali pictures. So I replied to him that sir I have already shared the pooja videos; then he replied you were also clicking pictures in the other room so I replied sir that was my picture with this ma'am so I replied in a funny way ""bass apni pics click kar rahe the"" so I just replied with some funny emojis then I just sent him all other employees pictures because I just felt the convo is looking like I just don't want to send any pics to him so I just shared them and said ""lo sir saari photos lelo ab"" so their was funny pic of one employee so he said she looks like someone has beaten her up so I replied to it.. also when I said that I was clicking pictures with this ma'am to that message he replied ""yes poori nazar rehti hai aap par""(Yes, I keep a close eye on you.).. so after that he replied to one picture in which I was with 2 seniors of mine he said that you're looking good in this and then I said thank you sir and then he replied to that poori nazar wala message of his that ""upar se aapke bangles aise aawaaz kar rahe the pata chal ja raha tha ki aap hi ho"" (Moreover, your bangles were making such noise that it was clear that it was you.) so I just replied with some laughing emojis and then he said ""and baaki kasar aapki heels ne kar di poori"" (And your heels did the rest.) so I was I bit embarrassed since I felt I was literally overdressed... So I just said ""arey sir😭"" and then he said ""sach mein ekdum dulhan ki behen lag rahi thi🤣"" (She really looked like the bride's sister.) so I felt he's making fun of me for which I said sir yeh toh thodi zyada bezati ho gayi then he said it was a compliment so I said ""thank you sir thank you vm!""  I wrote this because a fun convo was going on according to me then he said aap toh chid gaye and he again replied that ""sach mein acche lag rahe the aap toh tabhi toh aapke aas paas ghum raha tha"" (You were really looking good, that's why I was hanging around you.)and this message made me super uncomfortable and I just replied with 2 laughing emojis and then he said bye and all. So now after that I have started observing him but in office he acts just like a boss like I never ever felt any awkwardness or any other thing in office but I just wonder why would he say that to me at that time also even by mistake because he is my boss and very much experience so I don't expect such mistakes from him. I mean idk but now this thing always comed to my brain whenever I see him or someone mentions about him (basically 20+ times a day).

So I (21F) reached out to a Senior person (36M) from a big firm for career guidance and info on open positions via LinkedIn. He asked me to message him on WhatsApp. I did, and the first thing he said was to call him at 1:30 AM. I refused.
We then decided to talk the next day in the evening.

I expected a normal 15–20 minute chat about roles, skills, maybe referrals. You know, a telephonic interview. 

Instead, the call went on for 1.5 hours, and barely stayed on careers.

It started normally with “tell me about yourself,” but then it turned into:
Him calling me “mature for my age.”
Making these weird “jokey” double-meaning comments.
Calling me “princess.”
Asking what I like apart from work, travel, etc.
Stalking my LinkedIn profile while on the call.
Trying to make plans to “meet twice,” including a “Delhi day out.” He actually asked me for dates I’m free and kept pushing it.
Saying he wants to drop by my office to meet me.
Asking who was in my room when he heard a sound and saying, “I’ll stay quiet, koi kuch kahega toh nahi?”
Saying things like “you’re just like me” and “you’re so mature.”
At one point when I said I like things organised and in my control, he said “oh, you’re dominating.”
Also, “I’ve never talked to someone from LinkedIn for this long.”
And he told me I was “blushing” and “smiling” through the call.

Every time I tried to bring the conversation back to careers, he changed the topic again.

My parents overheard some parts and immediately said it felt fishy. Their first reaction was: “Why does a senior person need 1.5 hours to talk to a 21-year-old?”

I didn’t flirt back or encourage anything, but I genuinely didn’t know how to end the call without ruining a potential career opportunity. I didn’t feel uncomfortable in the beginning, but once he started pushing to meet, it felt gross.

I’m confused — did he actually cross boundaries or am I overthinking it? Has anyone else had a “mentor” conversation slowly turn inappropriate like this?

He now expects me to text him and tell him when we can meet… and I honestly don’t want to.

What should I do now? Block? Give a polite excuse? Keep it strictly professional? Or just say nothing at all?

I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve dealt with senior men blurring professional boundaries like this.

AskHR,1ojdlfi,2025-10-29T19:10:17+00:00,0,2,Need advice: Struggling with my reporting relationship and unsure how to handle it [TN],"Hi everyone,

I could use some perspective on a situation at work.

I work in a hospital setting and report to a manager who tends to micromanage and over-communicate. They often message me multiple times a day about minor things, double-check work I’ve already completed, and sometimes vent about personal stress. It’s uncomfortable and hard to stay focused.

I spoke with leadership about possibly changing my reporting line to better align with how similar roles are structured. They discussed it but decided not to make a change right now, and suggested I talk directly with my manager about the “blurred lines” in our working relationship.

I’m anxious about doing that because I think it could easily turn emotional or defensive. I don’t want to make things worse or come across as unprofessional.

AskHR,1oj86or,2025-10-29T15:51:23+00:00,0,10,[IL] Cost of living comp adjustment delayed,"Not sure what location to put, I work remote and moved from KY to IL.

I moved in mid-August this year to an area with double the rent for the same (or slightly smaller) sized apartments/townhouses ($1250 -> $2400). My yearly comp adjustment is typically in September. I told my manager that I was moving back in June/July and asked about a potential cost-of-living comp change. He confirmed that the company I work for does them, but because of the timing it might take place the next year instead. That all makes sense to me.

However, he asked me to raise the HR request for this. I did in mid-June, and they told me my manager needed to raise the request. I relayed this to him at that time. I then had to hound him to make that request which he kept delaying until he put it back on me in mid-September (past the annual adjustment time). I sent a direct email to my manager's HR rep (at his request) who told me that my manager did indeed need to raise the request.

My manager finally put in the request a few weeks ago (early October) and got back to me today with:

""Yes, HR responded. Unfortunately your comp is still in band for the new location. It needs to be fixed as part of the regular yearly reviews. They declined my request to adjust comp as a one-off""

The ""in band for the new location"" part makes sense to me (although I'm not happy about it). My issue lies in the adjustment needing to take place in the regular yearly reviews. Is there a case to report to HR that my manager refused to raise the case until too late for this year? He had warned me that it might be delayed due to the timing, but he made zero effort to even try for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oj86or/il_cost_of_living_comp_adjustment_delayed/,https://reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1oj86or/il_cost_of_living_comp_adjustment_delayed/

Our company policy states we are scheduled for 10 hours a day 5 days a week, except for certain holidays.

AskHR,1oj5t0u,2025-10-29T14:19:36+00:00,0,12,[NJ] Can I report my SV for insensitivity?,"I got sick in the beginning of the month with the flu and unfortunately bacterial conjunctivitis and was out of work for a week (FMLA) I came back to work last week and my SV informed me that I have an important email that I need to take care of soon. My job provided mobile devices for us to use strictly for work for us to clock in through our phones instead of the old way of punching a time card. It also gives access to our own company email. While I was out sick, my company email ticket expired and I have to create a new password for it but I wasn’t aware because I’m a blue collar worker — my job duty is physical and we don’t need to constantly use our email because it not a direct duty of ours, we only check our emails when the company sends out a training class and a SV has to inform us. If you can’t access your email through the company phone then you’d have to physically come to work to use the computer in the lounge to check your company email. I work nights btw.

The urgent email was about my badge and how it’s time for me to meet with the security department to get a new one (I have to get my picture taken). The email said I have to get it done in two weeks, I chose the Monday of the following week (so I have some time to make sure that the infection in my eye is all gone and be good to wear make up). They scheduled me the next day without me confirming and sent an email to my SV saying that I missed my appointment when I wasn’t aware of the time being changed to other than the day I requested.

I responded that I’m sorry for missing the appointment because of my technical issue but that I would be available for the following Monday that I requested initially. They said they understood and set it up for the day I asked for.

But my SV was out on Monday (the day security scheduled a day that I didn’t confirm it was aware of) got the email about me missing the appointment and confronted me Tuesday asking me why am I playing around and not getting this take care of right away (not knowing that I had already had everything set up with security).

Am I supposed to CC my supervisor in the email thread with security? Should I tell them I picked a later time because I’m waiting for my infected eye to be clear of it— I feel like that’s invasion of my personal medical record because the only person at work who would know about my issue is the nurse and the leaves department?

AskHR,1oiw7eh,2025-10-29T05:21:41+00:00,0,3,[IN] Creepy coworker,"Sorry this is kinda long. Hi, I want to start this off by saying im a guy. Im 18yrs old and pretty small. Lets start with some background. Im only 5'7 and a little over 130pounds. I work as a waiter in a little dying chain restaurant. Most of the people I work with have some sort of a criminal record or a past with substance abuse. I'd like to say they're all good people though. We've been getting some new people that are from a halfway house of sorts, yet again, all nice people to me and everyone dispite what theyve done. 

Alright, so there's a new guy in the kitchen. Hes just got put into the halfway house and got the job as a cook in the back. I meet him in the morning when were opening on saturday. Hes 28yrs old, and probably 5'10 and some change, maybe 190lbs, im bad at guessing, just know hes bigger than me by a lot.

 Okay. Now I'm not off putt by many people however, maybe two hours of my shift I start to notice how much he stares at me, and how the way hes staring is different, very intense. I even text my friend to tell him about how  output I am by it. 

maybe an hour after that a coworker of mine in the kitchen pulls me aside near the bar to tell me something. The new guy has said that he's in love with me. Wow. Okay.. she starts to go into more detail. When he was told I was 18 his response was a..  enthusiastic 'legal'. Okay! She starts telling me things that he's been saying in the kitchen, about how he's been going on about how beautiful I am, I'm officially freaked out. 

Im avoiding the kitchen like the plage now but maybe amd hour later the restaurant slows to almost a stop, no orders, no nothing. Now the kitchen is walking out of the back to walk around, get a drink of water maybe take a smoke break.

I'm crouched down under a shelf by the bar the shelf holds all the cups that we have. It's kind of a bit above chest level, but I don't think that matters, I'm still crouched under, it being a bit from my head, talking to my friends and such. He comes out from behind the kitchen and walks up to me and gets too close to me standing and it's in such a way that I can't get up anymore and yes whenever I do that most people come up to me and say, 'oh! Ya hiding?'. But when he said it standing a foot or so away, right in front of me, his crotch eye level with me, yeah? A guys gonna fucking panic. 

I hit him with the,'oh i guess so.' And he just stays there. Lookibg at me, not saying anything. Someone walkes up to talk to him but he stays facing my way and chats it up. He doesnt leave. Not until hes called back to the kitchen, maybe stood there for a minute or two. And now he keeps getting as close as he can to me every second hes got nothing to do and im around and vaguely alone. 

And thats about all, besides the way he'll walk up, stare for an awkward amount of time, then say something about wokr going well in the back.

 I told my friends, most of them women or at least afab, and I kid you not, they stole my keys to hook pepper spray on there. Which, okay.. thats makes me feel a bit like a bitch but i know thats just the 'youve gotta be a manly man' bit of me speaking. In other wards, im a bit freaked. I've talked to a couple of people in there about this, the bartenders, and they've all backed me up. But I also know there's nothing I can do. I've only worked two other days with him tonight included, but he's still training so he was very busy tonight. 

There are some other things that have bothered me but I feel like I'm looking way too deep into them now. At this point, I don't think I can do anything at all about this, which is fair, I mean, he hasn't really done anything. However, the fact that he was in prison for a bit and the way he's been around me, definitely makes me  feel.. like the pepper spray isnt gonna do much. I think this is why this is getting to me so much.

I am not due to return to work until 11/5. Short term disability is still pending my doctor submitting paperwork. For the most part, people from work have left me alone while I'm recovering. Today that all changed. 

Early this morning a coworker I often converse with casually called me and was talking about various things going on at her location (she is a manager at one store and I am a manager at another store). It was casual, and the first conversation I have had with anyone beyond texts from coworkers asking how I am. She mentioned she was going to my location to meet with my boss and teach my assistant manager some things. The call ended and was uneventful. 

Maybe 30 minutes later my assistant manager texts me 'Hi,if you are okay to talk can you please give me a call.'. I gave her a call, not really sure why, but not expecting it to be anything serious. She hasn't contacted me much while I have been out on leave. The second I pick up she tells me she is going to put me on speaker, and that my boss is there. He begins to start questioning me on my location being very over on payroll and why, and how it could happen. I am flustered at this ambush, and confused because one of our employees quit the day I went in for surgery and there have been numerous callouts as well. I explain it doesn't make sense and we should be under payroll if anything, and he continues to go on stating he reviewed everything and we are over. Flustered, I state I will try to look into it (I literally have no visability to anything payroll related while on leave), and start to get emotional (I'm on a lot of meds and have had some complications from surgery), and say 'something must be wrong I never fuck up with payroll'. I then apologize for my language and state I am not doing well right now and then end the call. 

After the call I am pretty angered at how inappropriate it was to call me while on a leave of absence and start questioning me on things I can't possibly resolve while on leave. I decided to look on our companies internal hiring board to see if there are other locations nearby with the same postion open, so I could maybe work under a different manager. My exact position, at my location is listed as available. My boss posted my job on the hiring website while I am on an FMLA. I have only been out on leave for 5 days....
I want to contact HR but I am seriously concerned about retaliation. I am not sure what to do. I am pretty sure I am coming back to a write up at minimum for the payroll, but possibly termination given my job is posted.

AskHR,1oiicb4,2025-10-28T19:06:59+00:00,0,21,[CA] FMLA/CFRA Support for Medical Events,"I have worked at the same location for 10 years. I have hardly taken time off in the 10 years I've worked there. Last year we were acquired and big HR changes were made.

**My Problem:** In the last 3 months I have experienced 3 major medical events: 1. I had an allergic reaction (likely to a work place rug) that resulted in multiple trips to urgent care and use of PSL. 2. I tripped and fell, got a minor concussion and bruised/cracked a rip, missed time for doctors appts and some rest. 3. Severe pain, bleeding resulting in about 5 doctors appointments, labs and hospitalization. The hospital said it was likely endometriosis, and I have follow-up appointments scheduled. Surgery is a last resort.

I anticipate the question will come up: the allergic reaction happened at work but I did not know it was an allergic reaction, and did not consider it a workplace injury when I got medical support. I thought it was a skin infection; however, after testing and doctors appointments and a last follow up, the doctors best guess was that it is likely insect bites (it looked like a bite pattern) from a rug I was sitting on at work (I work with children). I did not report this to HR because I didn't believe there was any way to prove that it happened at work.

  
Despite these events, I have been flexing my time to use as little PSL as possible and reduce time away from work. I worked the day after I was back from the hospital, for example. I have 30+ hours of PSL right now, but I was told I have used the max PSL hours (40) and I am not allowed to use anymore. I can use the PTO that I have accrued; however, I have planned for and saved my PTO for my honeymoon (I was married right before the first medical event happened, honeymoon is at a delay).

Given my history with this company this feels like a huge slap to the face. If I can't use the PSL I have acquired I will take unpaid time off for these medical situations until January. **However, I no longer trust my company and I want to make sure that I am as protected as possible.** For endometriosis, my symptoms are stable right now but I'll be starting pelvic floor therapy, and I am waiting to make a follow-up appointment with a pelvic pain specialist that is at a distance from me. I also have PTSD related to medical trauma, so I often have to take anti-anxiety medication for intrusive medical appointments which means I can't return to work afterwards (although I try to schedule at the end of the day to minimize time lost). 

These appointments of these will take up more time, which I will (apparently) take unpaid. **Would this qualify for** **California Family Rights Act Leave (CFRA)? Would it qualify for FMLA?** What is the process for going about this? Do you have resources you recommend where I can educate myself? I am in a senior level position, great reviews, and an important part of the company, so I don't think they would try to let me go but I no longer trust them and want to protect myself.

Endometriosis can only be diagnosed formally with surgery, which ideally we are avoiding doing. Is the lack of a diagnosis harmful in this situation for getting this protected intermittent leave approved?

AskHR,1oif7oe,2025-10-28T17:10:17+00:00,2,4,[UK] Is it worth raising an issue if I get more work part-time than someone doing full-time?,"I have been working in my current team for quite some time. 

There has been a particular day where I usually get appointments pre-booked by reception once every two weeks. I work 0.5FTE for this team and work elsewhere on the other half of my week. There is another staff who does the same role as me, but full time so they essentially do two days every two weeks (a.k.a. a day every week) of these pre booked appointments. I often find that my schedule is more likely to be completely booked out whereas theirs don't have any or very sparse. 

I've roughly raised it once or twice before, and the reception kept saying that they have their own system of making it fair and that it is booked fairly along with other 'reasons' (e.g. annual leave, etc), so I left it at that. It's been almost half a year since then and I still feel like it's still being booked the same way. 

It's quite frustrating as I do not feel heard and that it's being brushed off. So I went back to all the schedules booked over the past half a year and noted all the appointments booked in the past six months in a mini table. Lo and behold, I actually did more appointments in the past 5+ months working part-time than the full-time staff did. I can also prove that the reasons they gave aren't valid at all based on the evidence I have so far. 

As far as I'm aware, the full-time staff doesn't have any conditions/chronic sickness that would make them not be able to work normally full time. If anything, I have a lot of neurodiversity and adjustment needs -- which is like pulling teeth to get them accommodated for within the team. Generally, I can cope with the workload but starting to feel, I suppose, very disgruntled with how it is being allocated. I also have a feeling that the reception people really don't like me for other reasons as well. Part of these, being that I don't read social cues very well as a autistic person so can come off as 'rude' at times and that they've messed up multiple times about other things and I have had to email about it needing to be fixed. 

I don't think I'll raise this issue with the reception anymore as that has gotten me nowhere. I'm wondering if this is worth raising directly with my line manager? Or not worth seeming too confrontational? I do know that the company has policies for speaking up and such but I am also aware with these things, it is not always an objective procedure and sometimes the ones bring up issues end up getting punished in the end. 

My impression is that this line manager is fair-ish, but the reception staff are not under her management. I'm not sure if anything would change, but this has been bugging me a lot. Even at least knowing a legit reason why it is booked this way, say the other staff has some conditions making them unable to do too many of these appointments, would help me not feel as crappy (though I really do not think that is the case that they need any special adjustments).

I was told we would just need to go through the formal process of posting the position before they can officially move me into the role. At that time my administrative director told me that there is no mechanism for interim pay during the transition. A week later both my directors were informed they were no longer with the organization. As a result, the new leadership team chose to do the entire interview process but not to worry because I am the best candidate for the role. Now in October and 7 months of no interim pay of performing in both roles, the leadership team has moved someone else into the position. I inquired with my local HR to see if there is a capacity for interim pay, and surprise there is. What is the best way to approach this situation of inquiring and gaining back pay?

My leadership team states they are “transparent” yet I feel as if I have been misled and deceived for the past 7 months. I do not have anyone in my corner to help me fight this fight so I want to make sure I approach this from the best position possible. And yes I am seeking employment elsewhere.

AskHR,1ohxqjw,2025-10-28T02:17:01+00:00,0,23,Will I be fired? [GA],"So I work for a local bank and have just recently been promoted to a management position.

The branch I manage is brand new to the community and very slow at the moment, so while waiting for business to pick up I was asked to help cover other branches during lunches, primarily by providing remote overrides and check approvals.

Again, I do want to stress this is all done remotely with the approvals being sent to me via Teams chats, I am not physically at the branch to provide the overrides or approvals.

Last week, a teller from another branch sent me a request for an approval for a large withdrawal, over $1,000. I asked if the customer had been ID’d and what the withdrawal was for. The teller said yes they had ID’d the customer and the reason given for the withdrawal was home repairs. I did pull up the account on my computer and also saw that the customer did have an ID on file and it was in date. With no red flags presenting themselves, I approved the transaction.

Shortly thereafter, we receive a call from our upper management that someone had been impersonating our customer and presenting a fake ID.

The approval I gave was for the impersonator.

It turns out the teller did not properly identify the customer and accepted an ID the impersonator presented rather than verify their identity using the ID we had on file. This has now caused a loss to our Bank as the fault lies with us for not catching this.

Today, I was given a warning in regards to this and was told that final decisions will be made regarding this later in the week. The paper I was asked to sign mentioned that this could lead up to or include termination. When I asked my supervisor if I needed to worry, they said they could not give me an answer but that the wording was standard on all warnings.

My question is, should I be worried? Should I begin looking for another job?

I have never had any disciplinary action taken against me in my time with the financial institution I work with, only compliments, promotions, and awards. I have also been working there for several years at this point, but I cannot afford to be out of work.

In the course of their presentation, they might interject some kind of team-building activity.  

On three occasions (different times/places), the representative had us sort of follow their lead.  After some other tasks, they eventually said ""I want to ask you now to place your finger on your cheek like I'm doing"", but would instead have their finger on their chin.  I noted that they were doing this to assess something about us.  I have a couple of friends who are in HR, and asked them what they thought about it, but they weren't familiar with the tactic.

It would be odd but forgettable if it happened once, but like I said before, this has happened three times, so I doubt it's nothing.  My thought was that they were assessing us as managers who really listened to instructions or simply emulated what we were shown.  This strikes me as quite a childish thing to do to adults, but this is corporate America we're talking about after all.

The day went on and at the end of the day we had a meeting to go over safety and all. Once the meeting was done I went to go look for him to tell him that I would have to decline his offer but never found him. 

I never got around to telling him that I wasn’t interested and my coworkers and people around me were telling me that he was going to switch me but in my head I thought he wasn’t going to since I never really gave him a definitive answer so I brushed it off and didn’t think anything of it.

after i started, i was told it was now an expectation that i “help” at this other facility/operation for four months out of the year, but it was things i could do from my desk.

Lots of things going on in my story so sorry for the long read and thanks for any advice:

Just returned to full-time employment 10/13/25 after a long Covid infection made my childhood medical conditions harder to manage, so I was busy with that for a few years and also picked up a GIS certificate and data analysis skills in that time since that line of work is more accessible.

So the new job is at a state agency, and while I'm a little overqualified for data entry I was thrilled to get the offer because it's been hard to get a foot in the door with resume gaps and such. 

Unfortunately, several things outside of my control occured in my first two weeks, including my direct supervisor leaving for a planned trip 10/16-10/29, a sudden (to me) announcement of a renovation of the entire 11th floor of the building and a deadline to pack up and relocate to temporary shared cubicles, rotating telework due to the renovation/shared cubicles which started before my role-specific training (as opposed to general HR onboarding) was complete, and some sort of internal error with my local copy of a data automation program we use to streamline data entry.

And then I experienced a chronic illness complication on the sidewalk between buildings and had EMS called on me before I could appropriately respond. 

The response from the director of my division assigned to me as interim manager to all of these occurrences was at first frustratingly unavailable, confused when he noticed the lack of online data entry output from me, outright suspicion of my need for telework regardless of the 11th floor renovation or the ADA paperwork I'm trying to complete as fast as possible, and from what I understand my inability to comply as expected due to lack of resources (despite always honestly addressing his repeated questions, now always in writing) has now drawn out open hostility and frequent harassment. 

Yes, I have screenshots of the emails and Teams messages. But I'm getting scared that the laws and handbook policies I've been trying to carefully follow to protect me aren't going to be honored. For example, he suddenly decided to order me to come in person tomorrow for a meeting in his office. I've since been able to negotiate an intermediary from HR to be in the room, but my request to delay the meeting one day until my direct manager returns on Wednesday and could help as a buffer was denied, and I was told he can indeed tell me to come in regardless of my medical state until my doctor finishes the ADA paperwork. The meeting I previously had on the calendar for this afternoon with a different HR coordinator, which I had secured by documenting the emailed insults and such at HR's request, was canceled without explanation within minutes of him inviting me to this new meeting without explanation for the cancellation.

I'm honestly quite scared as a disabled person, and a member of other vulnerable communities, that one person with a title who didn't read his emails and is taking his confusion out on the people around him, is going to undo all of the literal years of hard work I've done to return to full-time employment.

Is there something I can do about or to better prepare before this meeting with the director and this other HR coordinator tomorrow morning? I'd rather not have to share a physical space with him for my own safety but disclosing that to HR privately didn't seem to have any impact.

Hi, 

Title describes the essence of the issue. The salary range I mentioned is the published range on the company’s own job listing, with identical title and role responsibilities. 

I just discovered this over the weekend. We have one of our three yearly performance & compensation adjustment cycles coming up in a few weeks - should I wait to bring it up until I see what adjustments they offer? Or should I raise the issue beforehand so we can discuss it before it’s all decided and finalized for this cycle? 

When I do mention it, should I ask my manager what she thinks or knows about this situation first? Or should I ask HR for clarification on how market rate adjustments generally work before getting into specifics? 

Also, what leverage do I have here beyond it being “unfair” to me, or a risk to the company’s reputation somehow I guess, or ability to retain me as an individual employee? Is there anything in particular I should say or do to maximize my chances of a fair, in-line adjustment? I don’t expect to get the salary maximum, but I would certainly like to at least be getting paid the published minimum for my own role…and if I am denied that, I would like to have a reasonable explanation for why. In writing, preferably.

Second, Alongside my job as a engineer, I started coordinating projects for one of our dept. Since I’ve always been a high performer, I naturally began getting involved in processes across other dept. as well. After about a year, when my work could no longer be hidden under role, I was promoted to PM, i expected a corresponding salary increase but that never happened. The usual excuses followed: “That’s the maximum we can offer,” “company limits,” etc.
I genuinely enjoy my work, so I accepted it, but I expected that if I wasn’t going to be compensated fairly, I’d at least get proper recognition for the problems I solve like preventing €800K in additional costs. However, I’ve started noticing that my manager gives recognition to almost everyone else from other departments, but not to me. For instance, halfway through an ongoing project, he thanked us for its “successful completion.” He writes things like “We did it, we successfully completed the project,” as if he had played a key role in it. He thanks me for “great communication”  (after I’ve handled about 30 different crises with customers, suppliers, 9 departments, logistics, etc.) and right below that, he praises another department lead who fixed a single mistake they originally caused, saying “Thanks for saving the whole project!” 
I’m building a reputation among my colleagues as a PM who removes obstacles and solves 99% of the problems, and I consistently receive positive feedback from both direct and indirect reports and I’m truly grateful for that. But every time my manager publicly downplays my contribution, it undermines that effort. I just wish my managers could see it too but it seems my boss is unintentionally blocking that, probably because he doesn’t realize how much I actually do, even though he keeps telling me I’m one of the key employees.
Honestly, I don’t know whether he’s simply unaware of what I actually do which would be strange, since we’ve defined my responsibilities together and he’s often CC’d in project communications or if he does know, but avoids acknowledging it because that would mean admitting I’m underpaid.
Do you think it would be appropriate and professional to have an open conversation with my manager to ask whether he understands the scope of what I do, explain how his behavior undermines my work, and tell him that I’m missing recognition? I don’t want it to come across as “baby crying”.
Has anyone experienced something similar? Did your manager start showing more recognition after such a talk, or did it backfire?

I email the listed recruiter from HR to confirm if they are still hiring for this role and let them know I would be really excited to learn more about it. No response. That was 2 weeks ago. I was salty but figured it was an expired posting and maybe the recruiter was slammed. Then I see the exact role posted on LinkedIn today with the little ""promoted"" note. 

Seriously, wtf recruiters? Was it wrong for me to ask instead of applying? I didn't want to apply without giving my current boss the courtesy of letting him know and I didn't want to freak my boss out with a heads up if the role was already filled or canceled. Either they completely blew off my email or they're looking for a different skill set and couldn't bother to respond to an internal email to say so. Ugh.

Generic low skill minimum wage stuff. And for the supermarket one I applied to three different stores under the same application.

These were the first two “interviews” I’ve had in over six months. Both two round interviews where I had to get interviewed by an AI by writing 150 word answers to set questions and then answer more questions where I video myself with a webcam. And yes the text interviews have AI detection software which reject answers that sound too “ChatGPT”.

I obviously got rejected from every single job after the second round.

I’m so sick of doing homework for low skill minimum wage jobs. Why the fuck do I have to fill out in-depth job applications that take ages only to get interviewed by an AI? Why do I have to record videos of myself answering questions? This is so much effort for a job that has a 95% chance of rejecting me!

But I have to do it anyway because these are the only job “interviews” I’ve been offered in over six months so I don’t have a choice!

Meanwhile, I’m still working the same retail job I’ve had since I was nineteen. I’m grateful that it has kept me afloat, but the truth is I’m slowly losing my mind there. It’s emotionally exhausting to feel like I’ve outgrown the job and have more to offer, yet still be stuck because nothing else has worked out yet.Another layer of frustration is that the people at my retail job don’t really understand what I’m going through most of them are the same age as me or older and still in college. When I try to explain how burned out I am from interviewing and getting rejected over and over, they just tell me to “be grateful you have a job” or “something will come along.” I get where they’re coming from, but it makes me feel even more isolated. On top of that, the pressure is getting worse because I’ll have to start paying my student loans back soon.

recruitinghell,1oygq9w,2025-11-16T08:44:48+00:00,26,8,All recruiting startups rn are a mess,"I just have to air this rant out... Most tools in recruiting are fighting the wrong battle. Everyone is chasing “better features,” faster search, smarter filters, more AI. None of it fixes the real bottleneck. The real bottleneck is trust, and nobody seems willing to talk about it.

As a technical recruiter, I see the same pattern everywhere. Candidates don’t respond because they assume messages are automated. They assume the role is vague. They assume the company isn’t serious. They assume I’ll ghost them at the first sign of friction. And frankly, they assume all this because the industry trained them to think this way.

Search was never the hard part. Outreach is the hard part. Getting people to care is the hard part. And right now every new tool on the market, especially the AI ones, is making the situation worse. More automated email blasts. More generic pitches. More fake personalization. More noise. It’s a race to the bottom disguised as innovation.

LinkedIn could have solved this years ago. They had the network, the usage, the data, the position. But they optimized for everything except trust. Endless automation, engagement farming, irrelevant recommendations, inbox spam. Now candidates assume every recruiter message is a bot until proven otherwise, which is a pretty bleak baseline for a conversation that’s supposed to change someone’s career.

The irony is that the only way out is not another tool promising “10x outreach,” but something much simpler, a space where engineers already feel safe, where they feel respected, where they don’t assume the worst by default. A platform that earned trust for reasons completely unrelated to recruiting, and now has the chance to actually use that trust the right way instead of extracting it.

And here’s the part nobody says out loud. If a platform wants to fix recruiting, it has to be designed to prevent the exact behaviors that broke trust in the first place. No ghosting. No bait and switch. No dark patterns. No mass-blast outreach pretending to be human. No features that encourage treating candidates like leads in a funnel.

Recruiting doesn’t need a smarter spam cannon. It needs a place where developers and recruiters actually believe each other again. That’s the only path forward. The next platform that gets this right won’t win because it’s better. It will win because it’s different in the only way that matters which is getting people to trust each other again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1oygq9w/all_recruiting_startups_rn_are_a_mess/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1oygq9w/all_recruiting_startups_rn_are_a_mess/

I’ve only had one remote job during this time, and it wasn’t even inside the US. It paid far below the US salary range, even though I have 10+ years of experience across Product Design, Product Management, Startup Development, and the past 5 years building real AI products from 0→1 (not fake demos or vibe coding, actual shipped work).

Trying to find a full-time job here has been extremely hard.  
And when you don’t have one, everything else in life becomes harder too.

I’m working Uber just to pay bills. It’s exhausting mentally because the whole time I feel like I should be home designing, applying, building… doing anything that moves me forward. But survival comes first.

I go to the gym daily to stop myself from collapsing mentally.  
I’m fighting depression and loneliness every single day.  
I barely have any friends here, just two cousins so I’m constantly trying to stay connected to people and avoid isolating myself.

And because of everything happening, my cousin and I built a small mobile app called CUBIC AI, not as a startup pitch, but as a survival tool for our own lives.  
We needed something to help with planning, discipline, structure, and staying committed to life when everything feels chaotic.

It taught us a lot about how planning actually works, and how to be more intentional, organized, and stable in real life. We’re still improving it, adding things that help us stay sane, motivated, and consistent.

But at the end of the day, I’m still here trying to find a meaningful opportunity.  
A real full-time job.  
A real team.  
A place to belong.

So I wanted to ask this community:

How are you all dealing with the job market right now?  
How do you stay focused when life hits you from every direction?  
What helped you stay mentally alive during long unemployment?

You can also DM me your LinkedIn, and I’ll connect with you, maybe we can support each other or share advice.

And if you’re a founder, small startup team, or early-stage builder:

recruitinghell,1oyd0sw,2025-11-16T05:02:37+00:00,0,7,This is my AI startup idea — I need honest feedback from people who’ve been through this,"**POST:**  
Recently I’ve been seeing AI applying for jobs automatically, which is flooding companies with a huge volume of resumes. HR teams are going through hell manually screening all of them.

So I came up with an idea:  
I want to build an AI resume-screening tool that scores each resume based on the JD, so HR can focus only on the top relevant candidates instead of opening every single file.

To avoid bias, the AI won’t look at personal details like name, email, gender, etc. It will only evaluate skills, experience, and relevant keywords. I’m also designing the scoring logic so the AI “thinks through” the match instead of giving random or lazy outputs.

**My problem:**  
I don’t know if this will actually help or if I’m overthinking it. Some people say it’s useful *only if* the AI is unbiased and secure. I’m putting effort into that, but I’m doubting myself.  
What if people don’t like this?  
What if I’m building in the wrong direction?

I’m halfway through my MVP, so I’m not going back but I need clarity.  
I’m **not promoting anything**. I just want to know if this idea is worth pursuing and how people feel about tools like this, especially from those who’ve built HR/AI products before.

I just know it's rough for you guys out here and wanted to leave a little innocent goodness for you. If you saw the eepy kitty and smiled, then my work here is done. 

Moving on, I do have a legitimate question: title. How can some interview processes last as long as you guys say they do? 4 rounds? 5? 6? *Eight, ffs?* Like how? I'm American but have been living in Germany for the last decade, and the interview processes have always been, roughly:

0. If contacted by a staffing agency, they call you in regards to your application, or they call you to ask if you're currently looking for a job and, if so, if you've looked at <company> that is currently hiring people like you based off your Stepstone/Indeed/etc. profile. This is only if you applied through one of them, so I put it at step 0. 

1. The actual interview

2. Interview with department head and/or your potential team lead, in the case where you spoke with HR or Recruiting first.

3. (Rare, but happens) Meeting everyone in person (if interview was online) and seeing where you'll be working. Can also have 1-2 hours of working just to give you an idea of what you'll be doing, but not more. Those of you familiar with Germany/the EU know they absolutely do not play about labor laws, so it really will be 1-2 hours. Can be lumped in with 2.

4. (Rarer still, but now we're pushing it): weird shit like ""lunch with the CEO/team/etc."". Is usually lumped in with 3, if not 2-3.

Dassit. You will either have the job or you will not, and you will find out no *more* than a week later. 

Therefore, and I know I sound naive as fuck when I say this, I genuinely don't know how interviews last any longer. Like, there's literally only so many people you can meet, so many times you can go over your CV, so many questions you can answer, before it's like, ""are we doing this or not"", especially when at some point, all the people interviewing me should have already known about me and/or received my CV and/or been informed by their colleagues about me, so what else do they need to hear from me or how or why or whatever.

Between Link⁤edIn Recru⁤iter, regular Link⁤edIn, Reply.io sequences, Gmail replies, and the occasional forwarded message from a client, my outreach has gotten messy. I keep thinking I'll remember where a conversation happened, but when you're managing 200+ open outreach threads, it is absolutely impossible to keep everything straight manually. I've tried color-coding, spreadsheets, Airtable, notes inside my ATS... but nothing really solves the core issue: conversations happen across five different platforms and none of them talk to each other.

These both came up in an interview and I genuinely wasn't able to answer them. 

For Q1, I have honestly never missed a deadline. I don't think that is such an unbelievable thing to say. If something needed to be done by a date, it was done by that date and often before. 

For Q2, I have had maybe two​ experiences of conflicts at work and they were pretty serious (one for overtly sexist remarks and the other for unwarranted aggresion). Both times were upsetting for me and my management were involved immediately and dealt with it, the only resolving I could say I did was report it to my management, but that just makes it sound like I don't deal with things myself, but isn't that what management or HR is for?

recruitinghell,1oxt7yj,2025-11-15T14:35:11+00:00,0,7,Why does every recruiter double-check AI results?,"One uncomfortable pattern nobody talks about: the bigger your recruiting tech stack gets, the more recruiters double-check every AI result. The AI tools promise to streamline candidate screening, but most practitioners still manually review algorithms' decisions because the match logic is opaque—and the risk of bias or error feels too high.

Everyone's hyped about AI reducing workload, but the reality is a messy workflow full of fragmented ATS systems, disconnected AI add-ons, and an endless loop of cross-checking. Instead of saving time, we're chasing downstream errors, and candidates sense the distrust in the system.

If it's a black-box decision, especially for high-stakes roles or regulated regions, most serious recruiters know they can't just rely on the match score. Without explainability, you get compliance headaches and erosion of trust—from both hiring teams and candidates, who already worry about being filtered out unfairly.

We’ve been testing explainable matching to surface reasons behind each score (skills, experience, bias checks) so recruiters can finally see why something “matches,” and defend those decisions during audits or candidate challenges.

If you want to stress-test your workflow, we built a free audit with 50 explainable match analyses: https://emplozy.com/landingpageaudit/",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1oxt7yj/why_does_every_recruiter_doublecheck_ai_results/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1oxt7yj/why_does_every_recruiter_doublecheck_ai_results/

Ive been thinking of a career transition into project related jobs in a corporate environment. In my previous jobs I didn’t have that much exposure to large scale projects or programme, but I am confident in my capabilities and adaptabilities, and I’ve got relevant certificates. 
I thought as long as I highlighted my strengths and experience and tailored every single application I’d get a job easily. Omg I was so wrong. 

I’d spend at least 1 full day writing one cover letter, some even took me 3-4 days. Mixing the wording from the ad with my own voice to keep the genuineness, having friends check my applications, and upskilling through online courses etc. I’d also write follow up emails saying things like “hey I put a lot of thoughts and coffee into this application”, BUT most of the time all I got was a generic rejection email. My applications just seemed never landed on the manager’s desk. 

After 22 rejections I thought, fck this aint going anywhere, so for the first time I asked my friend who works at the organisation I’d applied a job to whether they happened to know the manager’s email address so I could send the follow up directly to the manager instead of the recruitment team. 
My friend went “oh we are on the same floor, let me go and have a chat with them!” And BOOM 30 mins later I was talking to the manager, and 4 days later I got an offer. 

Faaa no wonder some people on LinkedIn keep saying networking is everything eh. Kinda ironic but tailoring cover letters just seems less important even tho recruiters always stress about it. I’m ofc thrilled to be getting back in the workforce but faaa a 2-min chat through a connection did MORE for me than all that time and effort of perfecting my applications lol. Faaa.

Our Recruiting Manager found this candidate last min and asked if I was available for a 4:30. I agreed to meet (big mistake). 

It started with the candidate following the office manager around the front of the office instead of waiting in the conference room or lobby. That already felt unusual, but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.

We began with a normal interview question (niceties, then walk me through your proposal process). She started to answer normally then began sharing extremely personal information that had nothing to do with the role. She told me she has multiple divorces, is struggling financially, doesn’t like the AEC industry, is tired of writing proposals but is “good at it,” and stopped smoking and drinking 4 months ago. All of this was unprompted.

As the interview went on, her tone shifted and she became argumentative and combative. At that point, I ended the interview early and escorted her out. As soon as the door closed and locked, I went back to my desk.

A few seconds later, I heard her tug on the door. Then she banged on the door and rang the bell repeatedly. She didn't leave anything in the office & she used the restroom before the interview so I don't think it was that. Even if she did need to use the restroom, I was alone in the office and felt unsafe letting her reenter.

I stay in a tier-1 city, so I should be able to find a lot of good opportunities, right?

Wrong.

I sent email after email, application after application, and even completed a design assessment, only to be met with radio silence or rejection. That too, from positions which are specifically for freshers.

2 recruiters who told me they wanted to interview me straight up ghosted me after I asked them for further details regarding the interview timings. One of them tried to get me to do an exploitative assignment, the other expected me to, “remind” him to set up the interview, then proceeded to ghost me after I asked him when he’d be available. At this point, I gave up on looking for corporate jobs because of the crappy hiring system and their reliance on AI as a part of their hiring process.

But what really hurts isn’t the response from these corporate employees. It’s the radio silence and the ghosting from smaller studios, which are clearly run by actual humans. They act so friendly and open, yet they don’t even bother to respond. I’ve tried every fucking piece of advice I could regarding why my CV or portfolio gets rejected, and it’s not made any difference. It also feels more like I had to be at the right place at the right time in order to get into one of these smaller studios, or just kiss the founder’s ass to get ahead (which feels really wrong but is unfortunately normalised in my field).

I also can’t leave my city for a new job because it’s not cost effective. I also think it’s a bad idea to jump into freelance work purely because I’m a beginner who could potentially get trapped into problematic arrangements or get lowballed by clients who treat me as a pair of hands or a donkey who simply does as they say, rather than a strategist. I’m at my wit’s end, and I sometimes can’t help but feel I made a mistake even joining the design field. But then again, I see ppl from other fields burning in their own version of recruitment hell, & I’m starting to think I was born in the wrong era at this point.

So for the past year I’ve worked a couple contracts through an agency. A very small agency full of very, very fresh recruiters. Someone at the director level over there has three total years of experience. Well back in October my former manager from a company I worked for last year reached out to see if I’d be interested in coming back again. They went on to say I was instrumental in the success achieved last year and would love to have me back if I’m interested. I said that I would. She replied to my email saying great and that she’d keep me posted. Fast forward a month I haven’t heard from anyone, so I reached out to my recruiter. Nothing, so I reached out to my former manager and asked if everything is still good to go. I then hear from my recruiter saying that it’s great they want me back, then gave me my salary and start date. 
The next week I get an email from this so called “director” who says the company has decided not to move forward with me due to concerns about my communication style because I reached out to my former manager directly. I immediately called her out on that saying that made no sense. She initiated the contact in the first place, I was just following up because I hadn’t heard from anyone. Then she back tracks and says the company was passing because they found candidates that are more qualified. I said what??? Two recruiters I worked with last year are going and both have less experience than I do. In addition, why on earth would someone take a candidate who’s never worked there over someone who has and did an excellent job?

They would never do this if they were not interested with my experience. Interview could not have gone better. HR reached out a few days later to answer questions I had during the interview which no one does if they were not interested. Now, I am not hearing back from them at all. I’m hoping it’s due to Human Resources just getting things sorted out but in this job market and even past ones I am jaded. I am very qualified yet crickets for the most part. Application after application rejected because they found someone that’s more of a fit without interviewing me and I call bs. That’s how confident I am when it comes to my experience. Then don’t get me started with the nepotism. Cousin Eddy gets hired again despite no qualifications and being a moron. Speaking of morons, in a recent interview I inquired about work life balance while speaking with a director since I had been working over 80 hours in a week at my last job. The response I received, we don’t work that long but we all work hard while we are on the clock. What kind of response is that? Cousin Eddy can work for that company as far as I’m concerned lol. No kidding, what are you going to say.. that you don’t work hard? How do you even get the impression that I want to know if it’s hard work from that question? I just don’t want to work 80 hours a week! It’s brutal out there and I hope I don’t have to settle working for cousin Eddy. One day, it will be a job market that favors the employee and I can’t wait until they start crying again about good help being hard to find. Especially, those outsourcing to save money.

He told me he hadn't gotten the feedback from the VP yet and he will let me know as soon as there is any movement in the process.

Did I fuck up by telling the recruiter? I'm the only person they're interviewing for the position at this stage and he told me the hiring manager is really pushing to move it forward but they had issues with the VP schedule and that's why the process was stalled.

A lady calls me at 10 to move it to 1:30.

Get there-guy is still not available. Lady who called will be interviewing me. She doesn't have an office? Chooses to conduct the interview standing in the stock room. 

Starts with basic questions then moved right along into expectations as if it had been decided I was hired. 

'Your jewelry has to come out.'

'I'm sorry Ma'am. That's not possible. My piercings are for religious purposes.'

She stared as of I had grown another head. After a few awkward moments of silence I made the *your turn to talk* face. She came back with 'We'll have to see. I'll call corporate.' -aka: how can I get what I want or resind without being sued. 

Wed-thurs MANDITORY for ALL staff-they get THAT busy. She was very intense about this, stressing several times how serious it was. 
Weird, but ok...sure...

If I call off for even one shift? Not allowed back on the schedule without a doctors note. (I didn't bother pointing out how HORRIBLY that concept hurts the business in reality...what chaos! 🤣)

'Ma'am...I don't have health insurance...a doctors note from urget care would cost me like...100$...minimum...'

'I guess don't call off then.' --plain as day, flippantly with a smirk on her face. 

'Ok...well that's extremely unrealistic...thank you for the opportunity, but I'll have to pass. Thank you.' -sticks out hand to shake.

She bugged her eyes out for a moment then  stuck her hand out PALM DOWN LIKE A FUCKING QUEEN. I shook her fingers harder thand paul bunion, laughed in her face, and left. 🤣🤣

I (23 f) applied to this dental clinic last week and had an interview last Friday for a part-time receptionist position. I went in and felt rather positive about it. Come Tuesday, I figured out that I wasn't hired (was told that they'd paused hiring.) No big deal. Am used to rejection atp. But I was kinda bummed so I decided to vent to my mom. She just scoffed and said ""I knew it. You won't be hired."" So I gently asked why and she just said, ""you just look ""unhireable""."" 

For context, I dress alt. But I'm not stupid. I dress professional for these kinds of situations. I have a single septum piercing which I'd took out the day before the interview. And I had VERY muted makeup on and obviously no crazy colors. I had my hair straightened and I dressed professionally. (Dress shirt, suit jacket and trousers.) I made sure everything was cleaned and devoid of wrinkles and had neutral tone nail polish on as well as trimmed nails. I had my ""crazy hair"" straightened and made sure to wear my hood up on the way to avoid frizz. 


Anyways, I asked her to clarify bc i was genuinely confused on what I'd missed. And she just kept pointing at my face and saying ""that. That is the problem. Look at yourself.""


I'm confused and whatever of my already shattered self-esteem that I'd built back up over the past 5 years is gone. I gave sufficient availability and was respectful despite them delaying the interview by 30 minutes. Was there really something I could've done differently? I'm at a loss.

12.5 weeks into 15 week contract, I've been contracting for 10 years in healthcare. Wasn't a great fit but I did what I always do and make it work to the best of my abilities and provide great patient care.

It was getting *hard*. Frequent schedule changes, inconsistent rules brought up. No answers from management on issues I was having. Barely any written policy.

A week ago, I reported an incident of harassment where a nurse, in front of a patient, repeatedly called me a pussy, and encouraged the patient to call me a pussy. I brought that up to management, who responded, well, you have to understand it's her personality and sometimes people joke.

Email response to my emailed complaint is we spoke and all agree that we all need better communication.

[It wasn't the comment that got me. It was the sheer audacity to say that in a professional setting]

Anyways, after that, they started messing with me worse. On this fateful Tuesday, they changed my schedule overnight (I work in people's homes, so scheduling is expected to be done the night before) and so while yes, I technically had a ""schedule"" I would have had to call all of my patients from the night before to cancel, and then schedule all new patients same day. I had an anxiety attack, called off, said this is inappropriate and not conductive to me being productive. We need to fix this issue or I might have to move to cancel the contract.

Manager said ""I accept your resignation immediately""

I emphasized that this wasn't resignation and an attempt to fix a serious issue, no answer.

To which she spent the next few days trying to figure out a way to fire me with cause and the best she could come up with is that I called off without notice until we'll into the evening on Tuesday lol (which my agency was timestamped on)

recruitinghell,1ox4eg7,2025-11-14T18:27:03+00:00,5,2,"Interviewed for what I thought would be a ""holdover"" job, largely due to money, but it's now coming out ahead as my first choice.","Got fired earlier this year, for reasons I still do not fully understand (whole can of worms I can get into), and have been looking for about 6 months. My industry is a bit niche, so I've actually been fairly lucky in getting quite a few interviews, but haven't nabbed anything yet. I've gotten to final rounds more often than not. A few times I got passed over it was probably because I got fired and the other finalist did not (this is just something that happens unfortunately), a few where it was a coin flip situation, and a few where I got passed over but told to hold on because they may want me in the near future for something else. (and I believe they're being genuine)

Well something came up that is a lower level position for quite a bit lower pay, but hit all of my experience, full benefits, and is fully remote. This is the kind of thing I would have just bristled at and passed over in the first few months of my search. But UI is ending soon for me, and COBRA doesn't last forever either. I figured what the hell this would at least be better than DoorDashing while I look for something better.

After two rounds of interviews, I found out that it's not only fully remote, but essentially zero risk of ever changing that policy (in my judgement), which is huge given how many people have had RTO creep up on them unexpectedly. The people I've talked to so far have been very chill and, well, normal. I know appearances can deceive and everyone puts their best foot forward in an interview, but having done a lot of these in my career, the signals in terms of personalities are about as good as they can possibly be. And in terms of advancement, probably quite a bit of room for it. So some part of me is wondering if I could close that gap from my previous pay in a reasonable timeframe.

I have a number of different opportunities on the table; upcoming interviews for hybrid jobs for quite a bit more money but with weekly-in office days, second interviews with places where the people seemed kind of... burnt out, not happy. Interviews with places where the pay is decent but the benefits are lacking, e.g. subsidizing ACA health plans in lieu group health insurance and the stability of the company is a bit questionable.

I am seriously leaning towards taking this opportunity, and it would feel difficult to take such a big pay cut, especially when other opportunities with equal or greater pay are on offer for me, but in terms of investing in a role that doesn't crash out like my last one did, I think it might be the move. The clinchers for me are a) the remote and b) they don't seem miserable or like assholes/secret assholes.

This has been a tough season and I do not envy anyone struggling with job loss in this market. I was close to landing 4-5 jobs throughout this time. By this, I mean, most companies are doing an HR screening interview, Hiring Mgr initial interview, follow-up with their boss and/or a peer, then another VP, and one final EVP check for these roles. And in each of those instances I made it to meet with the EVP. Super frustrating process, but I am thankful it is over.

In the end, the people who fired me, blessed me with time to reset and focus on what matters and I was able to increase my salary 20% and get a much better job title, which isn't everything, but my last title made it sound like I managed less than <$1MM on my entire desk vs the $75MM I left behind.

I am religious, so I am thanking God often and singing his praises and grateful to be blessed by him. If you are religious, keep God at the front of mind and focus on Him.

If you're not religious, and don't desire to be, I wish you well and hope you can find patience for now and success soon.

All the best everyone!

HW07



Final Update: As most of you and I expected, I was let go. My boss had me reaching out to clients for work tasks today and let me go at 4:30pm. It wouldn’t be so funny if it weren’t so predictable. I’m assuming he needed me to run Monday reports for him since he doesn’t lift a finger.

His reasonings were I had not made enough improvement in 40 days to prove I was capable of holding the position I had for the past 2.5 years. My old boss was even laughing at him when I updated her because she knows how many processes I improved and how much business I brought in the past 2.5 years ($10-15MM on a now $75MM desk).

I am also grateful I get to spend the next week with my kids before they go back to school.

UPDATE: My final 1on1 was scheduled for Thursday, July 31 and was moved to Friday at 10:00 then again to 10:30. Last night at 7:15pm, it was moved AGAIN to Monday at 4:30pm. I emailed my HR rep just so this is documented, but this seems highly irregular for me to have an expired PIP and no resolution until after the weekend.

Anyone been through this newest piece?

OP:

I was put on a PIP at the end of June and I’m fighting through it. I’m already job hunting and unfortunately had one say no late last week I thought was in the bag. Trying to keep my mind off of things, but it’s tough. I’m putting in longer hours and second guessing myself every step of the way.

Anyway, they’ve moved my final meeting from Thursday to Friday and I don’t know what to feel about it. At my touch point last week, I asked them to consider an extension since the period was around 40 days, but I have no idea what they will do.

I don’t know how to trust my supervisor anymore and my director seems ready to just toss me on the street. The most confusing thing is my supervisor frequently in meetings talking about things I will need to be doing in August/September, which I know for collaborative meetings is more in-line with the conversation, but even with my peer on a call he mentioned wanting to go over some things next month.

I have no idea how to read the room here anymore.

recruitinghell,1ox3ij8,2025-11-14T17:54:45+00:00,1,5,It's been a week. Should I reach out?,"I reached out to the SVP of a company I'd like to work at b/c someone mentioned they had a job open but when I clicked apply from the link they sent it was closed. I thought it wouldn't hurt to message the SVP with my interest and resume and I did. Shockingly the SVP responded in minutes and said she would check to see if they were still accepting candidates. She got back to me the next day and said it was indeed closed but they would keep my resume on file. At that point I thought I'd never hear back and oh well. 

To my surprise 2 weeks later a recruiter for the company reached out and said he was impressed with my resume. I went through a screening call and the next week I had my first interview with the SVP! It was a great convo. I prepared a lot for it and felt good after. At the end she told me next interview steps and other people I'd be interviewing with and their roles (2 more rounds). The final person is on leave and they are subbing someone in for the meantime since they'd like to hire someone by early December. I sent her a thank you email the same day and she responded the next day saying it was ""very nice meeting you and learning about your background and experience"". She also said she would follow up with the recruiter about our convo. 

It's now officially been a week. I know it was veterans day this week so that may have thrown things off. But I still haven't heard anything. I know corporate sometimes runs slower and I'm getting several mixed messages on tiktok about what I should do. Some people say follow up and say ""I'm still very interested and let me know if I can provide any more info"". Others say if they move slow I'm not a top candidate and should move on. But I don't know if this is actually slow. Mind you this is the first time I'm working with recruiters b/c I most recently was a federal employee and the federal government works WAY different than the private sector. The recruiter also did ask me if I'm in final round interviews anywhere else and I did say no but I am actively interviewing at other places which is true. I have another interview with another SVP at a different company, so fingers crossed something will land soon.

All and all, I'm wondering, should I message the recruiter OR should I just wait and believe that if they really want to move forward they will reach out? I'm just worried if me not saying anything to the recruiter comes across that I'm not interested. But I did send a thank you email and the SVP responded. It's also a Friday and in my mind it makes sense to message me today to get an interview on the books for next week before the week of Thanksgiving.

recruitinghell,1ox3c18,2025-11-14T17:48:00+00:00,205,17,"Attention all employees(yes, YOU):","As with a few users request for a birds version of my previous doggirl post(sorry, there are no birdgirls), I wanted to make one on a topic that I think is very important: self care while job hunting.
I know that this subs main purpose is to gripe and bitch about how AWFUL the current job market is and how awful recruiters and employers are, but I'd like to highlight something important: YOU.

Job hunting and putting in applications can be excruciatingly painful. I understand completely as I had a 6 month long stint of unemployment, got employed, now am currently unemployed once again. Some days, despite knowing the fire under my ass to apply for jobs(like I only have enough savings left over for one months rent then I'm screwed), I couldn't bring myself to apply. I was so depressed, anxious, and wanted to do something permanent.

Taking care of yourself is important, as it can not only give you the motivation to keep going, but bring a better quality of life. Think of it this way: your car only has enough gas to get you to your destination- but how are you going to come back? Our depression, anxiety, and any other underlying issues don't magically go away(despite being heavily relieved) when we get that offer letter. Money can be used to buy goods and services, but in my personal experience, whatever I was dealing with sort of...carried over to the new job to some extent.

If you are starting a new job- weather a whole new role or something you're experienced in, you still need to learn new rules, schedules, how to do the job, etc. That takes a lot of mental strength and energy to do so, and if you weren't ready for it, it could add a lot of extra stress. I'm not saying that self-care can magically treat and cure your depression/stress/anxiety, but I'd just like to highlight it. YOU are very important! Don't you remember all the fun things you want to buy, yummy things you want to eat, and cool places you want to go with the money you're going to get from your job? You need to be ready for all that cool stuff!

Some tips I've learned:

1. Make sure to eat a varied diet(if possible). Not only is eating the same thing repetitive, but you'd be lacking nutrients. Back when I was 6 months unemployed(younger back then too), I was nearsighted and was only focused on feeling full so I literally just ate instant ramen, beans, rice, pasta, etc. I had forgotten that Walmart had cheap frozen veggies that would've added to my nutrients and palate! When I finally got employed again, I noticed my hair started thinning(I'm an early 20s woman!!) And went to the docs once I had insurance. After a blood test i found out I was deficient in a lot of things, which made my hair thin and made me tired all the time. Even simple canned or frozen veggies would've saved me but I was too short sighted on saving money to spend the 89 cents for a can of veggies!! It took me a long while of taking vitamins to get myself back to normal!

2. Sometimes, if within your means, treat yourself every once in a while! I liked to do so as if to reward myself with a ""good job for making it this far!"". Nothing expensive, maybe an ice cream from McDonald's or eating out somewhere cheap. Keeping your spirits up is very important!

3. Pace yourself and set goals for submitting applications. When I just told myself to do as much as possible so that I could get a job and NOT be evicted- I ended up getting so stressed that I could barely get any in. Now I tell myself that today I have to put in 30 applications- I'll do 15 first thing after I wake up and eat breakfast, then after that I have free time to nap, read, etc. Then once I'm done with lunch and my fun stuff I'll return to finish the 15. It's easier to motivate yourself when you see a finish line rather than some inconceivable goal with no end.

4. Learn something new. Yes, something different, or go back into an old forgotten hobby. Deep down, we are all just animals, trapped in society. What do animals require at the zoo? ENRICHMENT. Get a pair of disposable chopsticks from Panda Express and learn how to use them, buy cheap painting supplies and learn how to paint, buy some modeling clay, etc. Do all of this in between applying for jobs. It'll keep your mind fresh and at the end of your job hunt you can show off your new talent!

Some things I want to remind/inform you of:

1. Remember to check your wallet/junk drawer for any gift cards that still have a balance! Also- see the reward points on your credit card if you have one! Maybe you have enough to either go out to eat or redeem them for cash or other fun things!

2. If food at home is getting monogamous but you don't have the funds to sit down and eat an entire meal, check out the app ""Too Good To Go"". It's an app that restaurants use to try to sell off the still good leftovers they had that day and lessen food waste. They're generally WAY cheaper than full meals and you can get good stuff! My local conveyer belt sushi place is on there and I can get an entire box full of rolls for only 11 bucks! Lots of bakeries are on there as well so if you want a donut or morning pastries to go with your coffee check them out! Grocery stores are signed with them as well, such as local ones or even whole foods, so you can get deli foods, pre-made, or even meat/seafood!

3. If you are looking for ways to cook at home but are losing steam on how to save money while not eating the same thing every day, I'd like to suggest the YouTube and TikTok account ""Dollar Tree Dinners"". She's an amazing woman that makes cheap but yummy meals from the dollar tree and other grocery stores. She tends to focus on buying ingredients that you can make multiple different meals out of, instead of making yiu buy a whole bunch for one meal. She does challenges like making a whole weeks worth meals(breakfast, lunch, dinner) from say 70 dollars or less. I highly recommend you check her out!

Anyway, to conclude: YOU MATTER AND I LOVE YOU ❤️ ",https://i.redd.it/fch6wfetf91g1.png,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ox3c18/attention_all_employeesyes_you/
recruitinghell,1ox2tly,2025-11-14T17:29:06+00:00,0,15,How are yall weeding out fake candidates?,"I am recruiting for several Software Engineer roles. It's a pretty easy role to recruit for because the requirements aren't crazy: anybody who has at least 8 years of exp, 4 years with typescript, and lives anywhere in the US is qualified. Of course, I've been overwhelmed with applications, but my calendar is always full of interviews!

Our interview process is pretty straight forward: recruiter phone screen, online typescript assessment, paired coding interview, and hiring manger final. 

In the 1.5 months this role has been open, I've run into 4 fake candidates that have made it pretty far in the interview process; one even made it to offer. I can't even count the number of people I've caught at the app review, recruiter phone screen and online assessment stages. Sometimes they're easy to spot: the location on their resume doesn't match what they put on their app or the area code of their phone number; when I call them their phone connection/dial tone mirrors someone using a wifi number; the person in the video on the online assessment and the person who shows up for the video interview are two different people. 

The team has talked about different techniques to spot these folks, but few actually work:

* Making the recruiter phone screen a video interview - only works half the time because someone else still might show up to the online assessment or other video interviews
* Don't pick people if you can't find them on linkedin - not everyone has one? So this is unfair.
* Don't pick people if they have an American name on their resume but clearly have an accent on the phone screen - this is racist??? We shot this idea down real fast. 
* Reject people whose IP address are different when they take their assessment - this one works 50% of the time. Sometimes I'll catch a guy who says he's in Chicago but his IP says Pakistan. However I recently got fooled by a guy who said he was in Texas, the assessment on the IP said Cali, and then he asked us to ship his laptop to India. 

At this point I'm wasting a lot of mine and my team's time interviewing people we can't hire. How are yall weeding these people out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ox2tly/how_are_yall_weeding_out_fake_candidates/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ox2tly/how_are_yall_weeding_out_fake_candidates/

My recruiter (and her manager) would stay in constant contact with me (I'd text her, she'd text or call me back within minutes, same with email). Last contact I received was the morning after the last interview (2 days ago) to let me know she'd be in touch as soon as she heard something but expected it to be very soon.

I texted her back yesterday afternoon to let her know I'd received her message and nothing. I also emailed both her and her manager as a check-in and nothing. I'm assuming at this point that I did not get the job because other recruiters I've worked with have at least sent back a message of some kind to let me know they're still waiting, etc. NOTHING from these folks.

I've worked with LOTS of recruiters during my career but I've never experienced ghosting at this stage.

While I supposed I could still possibly hear from them, I'm doubtful. Just be careful if you go with TEKsystems and realize this is a possibility. I realize that I'm not going to get every single job I interview for. That's fine, but at least have the courtesy to let people know. We are more than just numbers you cross off of a form. We are living, breathing humans who obviously need jobs or we wouldn't put ourselves through rounds of grueling interviews (I'm in tech, so this one had quite the elaborate test, with people watching me the entire time...not something I typically do for fun.)

I got to the second round in the interview process for a role that I just didn’t have the precise skill set for (I knew this going in, but wanted to see how much I could leverage transferrable skills and my relevant experience). They sent me the classic “great to meet you, your resume is on file” message. 

A few weeks later, I see a role opened up at the same company, completely different department, that is practically perfect for me: I tick every box on the JD and was certain it would be a no brainer to secure an interview with this department/this team, considering I had done it before with a less relevant skill set. 

As you might have guessed, it’s been crickets. I’m wondering if my file or resume is flagged as having been passed on, and therefore I won’t be considered for any future roles? 

Also, it feels important to add that both rounds went really well and my interviewer was receptive and engaged. So I’m not entirely sure it would be me not being a culture fit, but then again, who can really ever be sure!

TL;DR: If you interview at a company for one role and get rejected, are you automatically discounted from consideration in future roles, despite your fit?

It tagged my answer as:

“Candidate shows limited knowledge about the company.”

Bro, I answered that question perfectly. I mean it's clearly visible in the recorded interview. I literally studied their product and recent updates.
But the AI hallucinated the opposite and THAT is what the hiring manager sees first.

So now my data is saved on a random website, still accessible via the link they sent me, and the notes misrepresent me completely.

After 10 months of hard searching and applying for jobs directly through LinkedIn, GlassDoor, Indeed, ZipRecruiter and others, I connected with an agency about a 6 month contract-to-perm opportunity.    
  
Through this agency, after about a week of prep and coordination with the recruiter, I got an interview scheduled for a Tuesday afternoon where I met with the department heads.

Things went well and feedback from the recruiter was very good.  I was planning on being out of town the following week for my daughters wedding, so I told the recruiter if at all possible, if the client wants a 2nd interview, could we shoot for having it the same week.

They did, and I got my 2nd interview that Friday.  Met with 3 peer developers I'd be working with on the team.  That interview went good as well.

Fast forward to the following week on Tuesday.  I was having lunch with family out while preparing for wedding festivities when I got the call from the recruiter with an offer, and I start this Monday!  All-in-all, not counting the prep I went from 1st interview, to 2nd interview, to offer in exactly 7 days.

Admittedly, there were questions asked that I was thrown off by and to my surprise, it turned out to be a panel interview, which was quite intimidating. All of my efforts and self-assurance went out the window and ran away with my usual composure when it came to answering questions. I fumbled through each answer and ended up repeating myself or talking in circles.

 What was intended to be a half-hour interview wrapped up in ten minutes. It was difficult to get a read on the room. There was no feedback offered during the process, just jotting down notes or a quick nod before moving on to the next question.

I do not believe there will be a second interview or a secured position at this point. Understandably so, this is disheartening after having worked very hard on a resume, cover letter and learning new material. I really aligned with the values of this company and wanted to be a part of their mission; it seemed like an ideal fit and pivot from the career I just left. 

Trying to look at this as a learning experience and not beat myself up.

A bit about me:

* 3.5 years experience in hardware and embedded engineering mostly in medical devices
* Took a 1 year sabbatical to travel and now actively looking for work in Europe
* Currently in Europe and able to relocate asap
* Visa wise I do not have UK/EU work rights yet, would prefer to either get visa support and also wait to see where I land a role and then getting the appropriate visa depending on the country.

Where I am applying:

* Germany
* The Netherlands
* Ireland
* UK - mostly london

Roles I am going for:

* Hardware design
* Embedded engineering
* Electronics R and D
* General product development

The issue:  
I am applying constantly but getting almost no interviews even for roles where I feel like a good fit.

What I am wondering:

* Should I be having a professional summary (I feel like this is more for the cover letter).
* Do recruiters avoid people who are travelling
* Should I be tailoring my CV differently for each country
* Is being English only holding me back
* Or am I just presenting myself wrong

- no lunch break (yes, 9 straight hours of work every day, no lunch break!)
- software tracking every click, mouse movement, keyboard click and website searched uploaded to a database so they micromanage you. 
- no work variation.
- no opportunity to collaborate with other team members, or even speak with any. 
- little annual increase (1-3%, despite already paying remote team members pittances compared to US team)
- no sick leave, all leave must be accrued and used if you want vacation or if you’re sick (in my case, I was in hospital and they didnt pay me for the 3 days I needed off). 
- no work flexibility. Work 10am-7pm. Not 9-6, not 8-5. 10-7, all day every day. If you work outside of those hours prepare to be reprimanded. 
- they hide behind their positive code! Which again, on paper sounds nice, but it’s sooooo toxic! Voice any concerns or issues with your role (I.e. incorrect or empty project briefs) and you’re told you’re being negative and it’s against the code. 
- no HR. 
- no team events!!! No culture. If you want to meet with the team it needs to be done OUTSIDE of your 9 hour day, off schedule. 
- No transparency within teams or broader company. 
- only interact with your project manager. I never met or got addressed by the CEO, maybe a yearly meeting to give as insights into our team metrics and maybe a thank you for the work would’ve been nice. But nothing. You’re there to work, not engage.

2. Then if you look at your URL you’ll see that there is a number “86400”

recruitinghell,1owqbih,2025-11-14T07:40:38+00:00,405,688,"Salary negotiation backfired, offer rescinded. I don't think I did anything out of the line.","This is a local small company that is hiring a machine learning engineer. Their posted pay range says ""From 80k"". During the first round of interview when asked about my salary expectation, I said I'm OK with your range, and would like to focus on the interviewing process and discuss that later, the HM was fine with that. The day after the second round of interview, the HM moved me to background check stage, after a week of background check, I received the offer from HR. The salary says 80k.

I have been aware of the market value of 97k - 140k with average of 117k. I just never thought they'd pay me the lower limit of their range and way below the market. I called the HR the next day, expressed my desire to join, and gave a range of 95k - 110k. I was aiming for 95k cuz I know they are cheap.

Two days later, HR came back with a revised number of 85k, and asked me to tell them my decision by the next day. The email ends with ""please reach out if you have any questions"". After some thought, I drafted an email, again expressing my excitement to join, but explained the reason why I think my range 95-110 was reasonable, including the market number and my past achievement. I ended the email with an open-ended question ""Is there room to bring the offer closer to that range? I'm confident we can reach a number that work for both of us"".

Then I didn't hear from them for 5 days. Today I sent a follow-up email. The HR replied within 15 min saying ""After comprehensive consideration of various factors, we regret to inform you that we are unable to meet the compensation level you have proposed. Therefore, we will not be proceeding further with your application at this time. Accordingly, the previous offer has expired and is no longer valid."" It ended with good-luck-with-future-endeavor.

One thing that makes me dislike this offer and want to get higher salary is their working schedule, on-site from 9am to 6pm Monday to Friday. The 9 hours includes an hour of unpaid lunch break. Less annoying is that PTO is government mandated minimum 10 days instead of market norm 15 days.

I was expecting them to comeback with 90 and I would accept. Even if they say 85 is firm, I'd accept. I knew there could be a risk of offer withdrawal but still I feel them shutting the door like this is a little bit too harsh. I never raised my range, I never said I'll walk, they never said 85 was final. Should I call the HR to clarify my points and ask their reason? The downside of not joining them is I don't currently have a job and need building experience. The upside of me not joining them is that I can pick up my kids and cook dinner and not going to work 9-6 between Christmas and New Year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1owqbih/salary_negotiation_backfired_offer_rescinded_i/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1owqbih/salary_negotiation_backfired_offer_rescinded_i/
recruitinghell,1owpjll,2025-11-14T06:51:33+00:00,0,5,Feeling unsure about a “take-home assessment” for a job.is this a scam?,"
I had an interview yesterday with a company. Everything went fine. During the interview, the interviewer showed me a project they did on another platform and asked how the same could be done on Android. I proposed a solution. Honestly, it felt like the interviewer didn’t know much about mobile tech and wasn’t very experienced, they didn’t have much clue.

Now, after the interview, HR called me for a take-home assessment with a 3-day deadline. The task is quite complex. It’s an OpenGL 3D rendering task including heavy lifting from scratch,writing custom importers, 3D processing pipeline for mobile  , and it we can be a mvp for app. I’m good at these technologies, but here’s the thing: this isn’t just a small assessment. It’s basically a full  app and the code that they could use directly in their product they are working for. They even asked if I can create library in the interview.And I realised it is not of 3 days work.Though I have expertise in 3d rendering open gl and related tech stack and can provide a better solution than this.

A friend of mine warned me about this. Apparently, they do interviews to get free work done by candidates and don’t actually hire in some cases. Some of his friends have faced the same thing.

Now I’m confused. It feels like I might be doing real work for free, which is not fair. I am already in debt have credit overdues, so  looking for an  immidiate joining, but I have doubts.

Even the domain of the emails I’m receiving looks suspicious. The actual company domain I found online is ‘xyzstudios.com’, but the emails are coming from something like ‘HRName@xyzstudioz.com’.So there’s a difference, and they’re using a name very similar to the original.

A Naukri person kept calling me again and again to push their premium plan. The last time I picked up, he went on for almost 10 minutes non-stop about the service. I finally cut him off and told him clearly not to call again. And right after that, my profile views suddenly dropped. I’m not saying he definitely did something, but the timing was way too suspicious to ignore.

My views crashed to almost nothing, barely 5 a day. At that point, I felt forced to try their premium plan because nothing was moving. After using it for two months, I can say it made zero difference. My visibility before that call and after taking premium was basically the same.

The only thing that actually boosts views is editing your profile every alternate day. That alone does more than their paid service.

For me, the premium service was a waste of money. Don’t fall for it.

Has anyone experienced this on Naukri?

It was a pretty big pay cut and I really romanticized a previous job I was fired from. But… my new job is so welcoming and comfortable. There’s no ageism, no sexism, and no “boys club”. The company holidays are generous - every time there’s a Monday holiday we also get the Friday before off. We get our birthday off but can select the day of that week. I’m getting paid to go “holiday decorating” shopping next week. The owners are a young couple but SHE’S the president. When I’ve seen someone call out or need to bring their kid into the office, the bosses just say “do what you need to do - we would never hold an emergency against you.” I get to leave any time after 4:00 once I’m at a good “stopping point” (whereas my previous job would hold us hostage until 5:00). There’s so much laughter and joy in the office. Today my boss was talking about the “coming years” in my role - which is so comforting. I’m directly mentored by the owners - something that only happened to the “favorites” at my last job. They constantly insist that if there is anything I need to make my workspace more comfortable to just let them know, and make sure everyone has a home office set up in the event of inclimate weather or an emergency. I’m going through a really hard time right now, (moving because my ex financé left me and our daughter the week I started), but I feel so, so god damn fortunate for this job.

That day happened to be the same day and same time as my final year 12 English exam and so I sent them a very polite message thanking them for their interest but unfortunately I would not be able to do the interview at that time given that I would be sitting my final exam. I told them that I would be available for a different date or would be even willing to do it over zoom straight after my exam and was willing to hear any other options. This was on indeed so I could see that they had seen my message but they never got back to me.

Yesterday I got an email via seek that a company I had applied for was interested doing a phone interview between Thursday and friday 10am and 4pm. Annoying that they basically want me to put my life on hold for two days but I need the cash so I'll put up with it. Didn't recieve a phone call Thursday and just 1/2 an hour ago seek told me that it didn't look like my application would progress. Didn't even recieve a phone call even though they said, ""You will receive a call during one of these windows.""

It hasn't quite reached the end of that time frame yet so maybe I will still get that phone call, and if so fuck seek for putting me through that. Otherwise from the original email I can directly contact the employer - any advice?

I feel really demoralized being constantly rejected or ghosted by companies, and I feel like it's just honestly a soul sucking experience. For most of the jobs I can apply for (having only worked a 2 month seasonal position before and just graduated high school last week) there are so many applications and even the most basic ones they are all asking for experience or qualifications I don't have with the stage of life I am at.

Earlier today I had an interview that a recruiter set up for me. They sent me a job description for an economic development role, so that is what I spent the entire week preparing for. I am a new grad, so this was an entry-level planning job and I wanted to be as prepared as possible. Fast-forward to the actual interview. About five minutes in, I realized I was not interviewing for the economic development department at all. I was interviewing for a completely different department. It is still related to my degree, but it is definitely not the area I studied, researched, and rehearsed for. I chose not to bring it up because I did not want to derail the interview. I just tried to adapt in the moment, although it definitely threw me off a bit. I went into the interview in full SpongeBob mode: “Clear your mind of everything except fine dining and breathing.” Except for me it was “Clear your mind of everything except economic development strategies, current regional initiatives, and how your past projects align.” So when they started asking me questions from a totally different department, my soul briefly left my body.
I am planning to send a thank you email. Should I mention the mix-up to the interviewer or the recruiter? Or should I keep it simple and move forward?

The VP reached out directly for my resume and invited me to come in for a meeting. The goal is to see where I might fit, ideally at his company, but he also has connections with other VPs and CEOs in related sub/parent companies. So this meeting could potentially open several doors in multiple roles.

The issue is, I don’t fully know what to expect from this kind of meeting. I’m not sure which sub-companies or roles might come up, so I don’t know exactly what to research. I was planning to wear a full suit and tie to keep it professional, but I’m open to advice there too.

What I’d love to know from anyone with hiring/management experience:

• What do VPs look for in situations like this? • How should I prepare when the role isn’t clearly defined yet? • What questions should I be ready to answer? • What questions should I be asking them? • Any tips to stand out (professionally) when you’re just starting in your career? • Is a full suit appropriate for this type of meeting? • Anything I should avoid doing or saying?

I have an amazing one, but I did go through the recruiting process back in June and a number of other times in my career.  I hope we are allowed to post something helpful rather than just horror stories. So here goes my attempt to help people with recruiting hell:

Here is the problem with any help anyone offers on finding a job. First they are not you, what works for one may not work for another. Second the rate of hiring is less than the inflow of new job seekers there is a log jam. This advice is meant to be complimentary and cover new ground that you may not of thought of or inspire thinking. It is not to rehash same old same old, that is pointless for me to try.  That said here are a few things that may help or it may not, this is the best I can do:

1. Do the minimum stuff. Right resume, good interviewing skills, keywords to get past ats. Without this chances are not great, you have to start here.

2. Mental health mental health mental heath. How are you going to be good in interview or not sound desperate if your mind is shot and your relationship with your spouse is strained. Your job is not your self worth, you define that. You must struggle and fight to keep your own happiness and your family’s while job searching. It is just as important as resumes

3. No one is going to hire you without a job opening.  On linked in, find the people who really admire you and would love to work with you again. Also strongly prefer people who are influential where the work, not necessarily managers but respected. Go to company web site of that person. If you find good matches then apply and reach out to your contact and see if they can put in a good word. Rest is up to you. First problem you may have no such contacts or run out so this might be useless advice. Second you could tell them first you are  going to apply then wait for them to say ok, it is debatable which is better you decide.

4. Sure use linked in and indeed or whatever to find some of your leads but also make a list of top 40 companies you want to consider, go to web site, search and apply

5. Look at some sample job openings, what is it important skill they want or will make a difference but you don’t have experience? Is it ai or building bird houses? So spend a few days reading about bird houses and add it to skills on resume, not to experience section. You have the skill now but are clearly not an expert so don’t try to paint yourself as such. In the interview talk about the relevance of bird houses when the time is right and have at least one in depth example ready.  Do not say nor commit to being an expert just try to show relevance and continuous learning.  This will not work if this is your primary skill it has to be nested with other skills and when the discussion goes on you have to relate it back to the serious skills and experience you do have. The goal is not to deceive but to show relevance and connections. If you get asked your skill level say “learning but highly relevant and very exciting to me”. Some people may not like this suggestion, if you don’t ignore it. Not every suggestion is for everyone.  Also you are looking for a job right? Allocate some time to keep learning about bird houses.

6. Consider panting your experience as a T not a horizontal bar nor vertical bar. Meaning you need to be really good at some specific things, the long vertical part of the T, but you need to be adaptable to other areas that are going to be relevant, the horizontal part.

7. Unless you are going for a purely executive role, do not overemphasize just leading people and getting things done through others. Companies are thinning management ranks. What tangible hard skills do you specifically have what are you personally good at?

8. Energy and AUTHENTICITY matter in the interview. Be your authentic self. Don’t get up and do a stand up comedy routine but don’t be a robot either

9. Consider contract roles, these have been historically easier to get than full time, and may provide a stop gap until something permanent is available

I can barely handle sitting at a desk, but my sister can't afford to house and care for me anymore and the gov took my insurance. I have $20 to my name from returning pop bottles. I have fallen so far and I am trying soo hard to not let my circumstances take away my hope but GODDAMN.

Any advice or help would be so very appreciated.

Your posts, grit, and perseverance kept me going during a tough time, and I’m eternally grateful for the advice I found here. As a result, I will pass forward what worked for me.

1. Take initiative as soon as you find out your position is being eliminated or funding is likely not being renewed. To do this, look over past performance reviews and write every accomplishment and task you can think of for every job.  Do not use AI at this point, but feel free to find positive action verbs through other resources. Do not be alarmed if your resume is over 5 pages long at this point.

2. Begin looking for jobs that have been live/posted for less than 24 hours, and actively find listings where you meet BOTH required and preferred qualifications. Most of my rejections were from dated job listings or ones where I did not meet all preferred criteria.

3. At the same time, reach out to your network to see if anyone knows of open positions/would be willing to get you in contact with hiring managers. I was able to find part-time work through my social network that helped pay the bills while looking for other work.  I also received 2 other additional interviews and job offers through friends’ friends.

4. Once you find jobs that have been posted for less than 24 hours, and understand the value of applying early, use AI as a tool to make sure your resume passes ATS for the particular job description and craft a cover letter. This is when your 5 page resume condenses into 1, and is perfectly tailored for the job. Also, read and edit your new bullets to make sure they make sense and sound natural while also surviving ATS. This is crucial and an oft forgotten step. 

5. I can do another post on interviews if you want tips, but generally the biggest problem in job searches is getting to the interview. The above worked for me, but your mileage may vary.

Other thoughts/stats:

1. Spray and pray vs. timely tailored: I have never tried spray and pray because my success has come from timely tailored applications.  Over the course of my month-long search, I applied to 20 jobs, got 6 interviews, and 5 job offers. Most rejections were early on where I was still figuring out the best course of attack, and my numbers improved significantly towards the middle of my search.

2. Do not give up, and put most of your work into creating an amazing first resume that is finely tuned for ripe job applications- I am continuing to cheer for you, so good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ow62vk/the_long_night_is_over_advice_from_my_monthlong/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ow62vk/the_long_night_is_over_advice_from_my_monthlong/

I have been applying for jobs in Europe for over 5-6 months now. I have probably applied to 300-350 positions. I was interning at a company before this where everything looked good to continue as well but things did not go through because of a hiring freeze in the company. I  have had a terrible experience with the HR in almost all companies. Except a handful of companies  where the interview decision was timely conveyed or the rejection and the process were effectively informed, the others were an absolute mess. I have had an instance where I interviewed a couple of rounds with a startup and they asked me to do a case study for one of their probable assignments in the future  but emphasised that it is out of my domain to test me and that they do see a strong fit in general. The interview was really good and they were really happy with the suggestion and they had not thought of that solution(overall very positive feedback). Two days later, I get a rejection that the fit was not proper which absolutely made no sense and contradicts to their previous statements. Today, I had a call with the HR for another company and she had agreed for the slot and sent a link.  She just did not show up or even respond to my mail the entire day. Why can not companies be honest about what they want ? They can literally  convey the process and be transparent. I have been genuinely having increasing hatred towards HR personnel . Their main job is to deal with people and they are absolute shit at it . I have had rarely an instance or two where I was happy with the HR communication. These are just couple of the instances: just want to know if others faced similar issues or is there anything I could do ???

recruitinghell,1ow2k6n,2025-11-13T14:31:07+00:00,0,28,You Met Every Requirement. So Why Didn’t You Get the Job?,"When I talk with early-career job seekers—or really, job seekers at any stage—the same question comes up again and again: *“Why was I rejected when I’m clearly qualified?”* I get it. I’ve sat on both sides of the hiring desk. I’ve been the one applying, confident that I check every box, and I’ve also been the employer reviewing stacks of resumes from people who could all do the job well. And the truth is far more complicated—and far less personal—than most candidates ever hear.

In a soft labor market, employers often have more qualified candidates than they need. That’s not a knock on you. It’s simply the math of supply and demand. When a company posts a job and fifty people who meet all the “required” qualifications apply, the odds of any one of them getting hired are low even when every one of those fifty could succeed. I’ve seen candidates beat themselves up over rejections, wondering if their skills weren’t strong enough, if they should’ve taken another internship, or if the typo they caught just after hitting “submit” doomed them. But almost always, the rejection has nothing to do with a lack of qualification. It has everything to do with another candidate having some edge you couldn’t have known about.

Here’s the part candidates rarely see: employers have needs they don’t put in the job posting, often because they don’t believe those needs can realistically be met. Think about a sales role. The hiring manager might list required experience, preferred skills, industry familiarity, and maybe a track record of hitting quotas. They’re not going to say, “Bonus points if you’ve recently sold to our absolute dream client.” Why? Because the chances of someone walking in with that exact connection seem close to zero. And yet, sometimes lightning strikes. You might have two excellent candidates who both check every box, but one casually mentions having landed a major deal with the very prospect the employer has been chasing for years. That detail isn’t a requirement. It isn’t even a preference. It’s simply a differentiator so rare the employer never imagined they’d see it. But if they do see it, it can tip the decision instantly.

This is why you should never interpret a rejection letter as a commentary on your worth or your future. Hiring is full of hidden variables. Maybe the selected candidate brings a niche certification that perfectly complements a new initiative leadership hasn’t announced yet. Maybe someone on the team has worked with them before and knows they’ll hit the ground running. Maybe their personality fits the existing group dynamic just slightly better. These aren’t things you can control. They’re also not things an employer will ever spell out in a rejection email. But they matter, and sometimes they’re the deciding factor.

Another overlooked reality is how subjective hiring can be. Even in the most structured hiring processes, with scorecards and standardized questions, people still bring their own preferences, instincts, and experiences into the room. It’s common, especially in larger organizations, for different interviewers to favor different candidates. One person might connect with you instantly, while another feels a stronger pull toward someone with a slightly different background. You can be the hiring manager’s first choice and still lose out because the committee preferred someone else. That doesn’t make you less qualified. It just means the internal politics leaned another direction that day.

I’ve also watched hiring managers agonize over decisions because choosing between two or three strong candidates feels like choosing between good and good. In those cases, the final pick often comes down to something tiny. It might be a comment made toward the end of the interview that resonated with someone on the panel. It might be experience with a tool or industry that aligns with a client the team wants to win. It might even be a shared hobby—something that helps an interviewer picture the candidate collaborating more easily with the group. When candidates are equally strong on paper, these small human moments can shift things. That doesn’t make the process unfair. It just makes it human.

And here’s something most candidates never hear: new hires don’t always work out. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen an employer pick one candidate, only to discover weeks later that the fit isn’t right. It happens far more often than you’d think. Maybe expectations weren’t aligned. Maybe the candidate oversold a skill. Maybe the culture wasn’t what they hoped for and they self-eject. Or maybe they’re great, but the company’s needs evolve faster than they can adapt. Hiring is risky, and employers know it.

That’s why staying connected after a rejection is one of the most powerful things you can do. I’m not talking about pestering the hiring manager or sending weekly check-ins. I mean sending a genuine thank-you, connecting on LinkedIn, and finding an occasional, natural reason to stay in touch—commenting on a post, congratulating them on a company milestone, sharing an article relevant to the role. Life happens fast inside organizations. Priorities shift. Budgets expand. New positions open up. And when a hiring manager suddenly needs someone who can hit the ground running, they’re going to think first of the person who was already “almost hired” and who stayed engaged in a professional, non-pushy way.

I’ve seen candidates who were rejected for a role get hired months later when the first-choice candidate moved on, struggled, or simply wasn’t the fit people imagined. I’ve seen companies skip the entire interview process for a rehire because the candidate had already proven their professionalism, attitude, and preparation. When you’re second place today, you’re often first in line tomorrow. But only if you keep the relationship alive.

If you’re early in your career, this kind of rejection can feel especially discouraging. You’re trying to build confidence, prove yourself, and break into industries that can already feel impenetrable. But job searches are rarely linear. A “no” today might have nothing to do with your abilities. It might simply reflect timing, competition, or invisible needs within the company. What matters most is how you respond. Stay gracious. Stay visible. Stay connected. The hiring manager remembered you the first time, and if you show professionalism after the rejection, they’ll remember you even more.

The next time you get that frustrating rejection email, take a breath. Remind yourself that checking every box doesn’t guarantee an offer because someone else may have brought something exceptional that couldn’t have been predicted. Don’t let one “no” undermine your confidence or your momentum. Keep applying, keep learning, keep showing up—and keep treating every interaction with an employer as the beginning of a long-term relationship rather than a single transaction.

Strong candidates rise. Sometimes not immediately, and not always in the order we expect. But they rise. And when they do, it’s often the employer who feels lucky to have a second chance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ow2k6n/you_met_every_requirement_so_why_didnt_you_get/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ow2k6n/you_met_every_requirement_so_why_didnt_you_get/

Since the end of April, I’ve had around 36 first-stage interviews, 40 recruiter calls, and about 6 final-stage interviews but I still haven’t received a single offer. Every rejection I get is completely generic, never anything nuanced or constructive.

I’ve applied for Account Executive roles in tech (my most recent field) as well as advertising and media, where I worked for 3 years before moving into tech sales (7years total sales experience). I’ve consistently hit or exceeded my targets in every role I’ve held.

I’ve applied widely across industries, salary ranges, and company sizes, and still nothing seems to move forward. I’ve had several 3 or 4 stage processes where I’ve been asked to come in person, sometimes travelling over 1.5 hours each way, only for the company to either ghost me or tell me they’ve paused hiring. It’s incredibly demoralising and financially draining.

recruitinghell,1ovvvc4,2025-11-13T08:30:50+00:00,11,4,Candidates That Ramble,"Today during a phone screen with a social worker candidate I was told a wild story. It centered around why the candidate didn’t commute via car any longer. She said she was involved in a vehicular accident. When i empathized and said I hope she was ok and that no one was hurt, she went on to tell me that the other driver was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and begged her to not call the police because they didn’t want to go to jail.

The candidate went on to say that the intoxicated driver reminded her of herself because she was arrested for a DUI
and understands how hard that can be on someone. 

She continued to ramble and say she took the drivers insurance information and didn’t call the police. After they exchanged information she let the other driver take off, sans their car door! Which apparently came off in the accident. 

All I could think was, she knowingly let this person get in their car under the influence to potentially hit  someone else. For a potential social worker, it’s a huge red flag/boundary issue. 

And almost like she read my mind, the candidate said, “ I have a lot of empathy as a social worker and I gave the driver resources if they wanted help either their recovery but I still think to this day, did i do the right thing? Did that driver get home safely or did they hit someone else and kill them?” 

I had no words and had to think of a way to wrap up the questions to end the call. 
So I asked the question again. “Are you able to commute to the office Monday to Friday?” 
And immediately scheduled a rejection notice to send out at 5pm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ovvvc4/candidates_that_ramble/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ovvvc4/candidates_that_ramble/
recruitinghell,1ovud0z,2025-11-13T06:54:46+00:00,9732,994,Interviewed and hired two people this year. The people that showed up to work were not the people we interviewed.,"Update:

One of the agencies was local. Unlikely to have really been in on it.

---

Good news:

It looks like we're seriously considering in-person interviews again even if it limits our recruiting pool. During the pandemic, the whole org went remote/remote policy and never really went back because they were saving so much money on space.

Supervisor is not going to let this fly- someone is taking responsibility in HR or at the agency.

---

Clarifications, because somehow this is all my fault?

This is a public sector organization. We have less money than the private sector.

I am not a recruiter. I'm a software engineer on a very small team. I am not leadership, HR, a recruiter, etc. I'm just working with what I've got and try to hire the candidates I would want to work with. I emphasize skill over ""culture fit"", which, we aren't even really allowed to consider.

This has nothing to do with resumes. If you meet 50% of the bullet points and have stack experience you're probably getting an interview.

We read the resumes ourselves and usually discard the 10 page ones in favor of the 1-2 page ones. I know a dart board when I see one. I know an effective communicator when I see one. 10 pages at 10pt font ain't it.

We've never pursued a unicorn candidate because they don't apply to this job. Our unicorn candidate, at this point, is someone that has worked in .NET and can write C#. It's a really low bar and most of these folks just lie on their resumes, I guess. If you can meet at least half the bullet points I'm of the mind that we can teach you the rest.

Not a tech company or industry. It's an organization with a tech department.

1-2 rounds after a phone screen. The interview is an hour of soft skills and 1-2 technicals that would be considered painfully easy to anyone with any stack experience. No DS&A.

I lived the job market fairly recently and advocate for a more respectful process.

This organization has hundreds of thousands of people. I have no say over hiring process or compensation. I can only keep providing feedback after the fallout and hope they learn. But I doubt they will.

On the upside, it seems like we're on track to go back to in-person interviews. For remote, we may ask them to hold up their government issued ID.

I'm sorry to all of you DMing me but we're not hiring right now- especially after this fiasco. HR and leadership need to go re-evaluate their process so this doesn't happen again. For those of you blaming me- scammers wouldn't scam if it didn't work. Usually, the interview weeds out the resume lies, but when they also hire someone to interview for you that does interview well.. suffice to say, I'm not psychic.

To that one person that told me to kill myself and that I shouldn't have a job? I feel sorry for you.

---

OP:

I am so tired of this. I'm going to propose that HR blacklists the agencies and that we go back to in-person interviews; even if they are ultimately remote friendly positions:

This is software engineering.

The first guy we interviewed was charismatic and knowledgeable. The guy that showed up could barely code. We let him go pretty quickly and never really confirmed it was a bait and switch. Just seemed way off. They could have been twins and we couldn't confirm it. They often refused to be on camera.

The second guy was an all star, local, and wrote immaculate code. The guy that showed up was located a few states away. He finally started after weeks of delaying his start date due to an accident involving his kids and then the death of both grandparents. That's also why he had to move. Also, he developed a south Asian accent and forgot he met me.

I asked him specifically about a fun topic we discussed in the interview (pretty easy to remember) and, conveniently, his wi-fi went out. It was an easy litmus test and he failed spectacularly and confirmed what we suspected: This was not the same guy.

But now we're smarter and have gathered documentation. We have screenshots. We have their clearly AI generated certificates. I also want to reiterate that the people that showed up could have passed for the people we interviewed so apparently there's this whole industry of people interviewing for other people. They looked similar enough but this last guy was just a completely different person.  No doubt.

Scams and fraud. So many hours and dollars wasted. Worst of all, our team will deal with the perceived fallout and we'll be even more behind on our work.

Hiring contractors is hell but they won't invest in salaried employees because they don't want to be on the hook for them. You get what you pay for, though.

I was supposed to have heard back about my application status at the end of last week and now it’s already Wednesday of this week. My assumption is that I’m being ghosted and I didn’t get it, but there’s a little part of me that is holding onto some hope. I am planning to send an email to the recruiter checking in tomorrow, but I don’t know it feels a little hopeless.

I’ve applied to over 180 jobs (over 200 counting sites outside of indeed and LinkedIn). I didn’t start getting interviews until month 6. Not counting one referred from one of my friends.

I recently received an offer from a company that ended up rescinding before the deadline went up. Basically I had another interview happening at the same time that had a 20k difference. I was definitely overqualified but was willing to take the job. The recruiters spoke to HR and we agreed that I’d have a 12pm deadline. I signed at 11:30am only to get an answer at 2:05 that they rescinded the offer in the morning. This happened 2 weeks ago but I see the job is still up on indeed. 

I’m tempted to reach out and see if I can still get that job but I know the company is probably not the best if they pulled that. It seemed like I was top 2 for the other company I interviewed for. I had my best interview but still wasn’t able to get the job. I have 3 weeks left in unemployment. I’m pretty stressed. I reached out to all my contacts and have gotten referred by multiple friends but haven’t gotten any interviews from it. I started my journey going through a 4 interview process in July only to be told by the company that “there are no positions available” even though my friend is a director and the reason I had the interviews in the first place was so they could create a position for me. I know the job market is hard and everyone keeps telling me I’ll get a job but there has to be something that I’m doing wrong since many people have gotten a job before me. I’m also a new dad so I’ve been taking care of my kid full time during this hiatus which definitely limited some of my job applications.

They told me that due to internal equity that they had to keep me at the lowest hourly wage. I then brought up the posted range and how I do come to them with experience. They then said that the actual bottom was $2.00 lower then what they offered me for the position because they were taking my experience and internal factors into account. Yet, this new bottom brought up to me verbally by the recruiter is not what is posted as the bottom of the range on the written posting on the company website. 

I feel that they were not being truthful with what the range actually was for hiring.

recruitinghell,1ovre5i,2025-11-13T04:09:22+00:00,2,0,Corporations have all the data. People should have it too.,"Basically I've been through it all like many people here, which had left me feeling extremely dejected. I started researching what jobs actually fit me in order to use my time more effectively. Given the whole market kind of sucks, which jobs and industries did I have the best chance at getting? Which ones best fit my values like autonomy and work life balance?

But I couldn't find any helpful information backed by real data. Everything was scattered. Each industry had its own subreddit or completely own website. That made it hard to piece together everything. I also found career sites extremely outdated and not reflective of actual roles on the job market.

This desperation for some website or resource and seeing too many similar struggles (like from my friends and those here), led me to take things into my own hands. I'm building a tool based on real data that shows you genuine career possibilities tailored to you in terms of skills, interests, and values. It can also tell you which careers or jobs have more openings, are more competitive, or have a higher barrier to entry.

If this sounds useful to you, sign up here: [findyour.stream](http://findyour.stream/?source=r/recruitinghell)

It's still an early version. Right now I'm mostly trying to validate the idea first and see if people actually find this helpful. You can try it out and provide honest feedback. 

What's crazy is that corporations already have a lot of this data. They know which industries are growing, salary pay bands across different roles, and where opportunities lie. That's because they have money to pay for this kind of expertise. Regular people don't.

My aim is to democratize this data for people. Everyone should have access to it. More data for us means more informed decisions we can be making. Sure, some websites exist that provide salary information, and there are niche forums, but I want to be able to compare my full set of options in one place.

I need some guidance regarding my upcoming Microsoft background verification with HireRight.

During my college years, I worked in two very short stints (around 2 months each) at small companies. These were early exploratory jobs, and I left them quickly to focus on finishing my degree. Because they were extremely brief and happened before graduation, I never included them in my resume or employment history.

However, these companies still show up in my EPFO/UAN employment history because PF contributions were made at the time. My concern is:  
**Will HireRight flag these as “undisclosed employment,” and can this cause any issues with Microsoft?**

For context:

* I’ve already cleared all interviews.
* My current employer used AuthBridge for BGV and these entries were *not* flagged there.
* I didn’t have to explain anything to my current company.
* These old roles were during college, not part of my professional career, and there was no misconduct or disciplinary action.

Has anyone gone through something similar?  
If HireRight finds additional employers via EPFO, does Microsoft India just ask for clarification, or can it affect the offer?  
Any personal experiences or advice on how to handle this would be really helpful.

  
Question ? 

Will microsoft recruiter understand my situation explaining that these were before my graduation and during my college days , stating that I don't even include them in my resume which I actually did not for obvious reasons. Or will they simply rescind the offer ?

Timeline:

Mid-Oct: Applied for a role that I have all of the qualifications for.
Late Oct: Recruiter calls me BEFORE my scheduled screening to say ""I didn't want you to feel like you had to wait to hear from us"" (I've never had this happen in 15+ years)
Halloween: 60+ minute phone interview with recruiter (way over the typical 30-45 min). She asks thoughtful questions, we go deep on my background. She says she'll present me at 10% higher than the initial salary range. She presents candidates to hiring manager
Early Nov: Multiple proactive check-ins from her via email/phone saying ""still in review,"" ""they're dragging it out,"" expressing frustration that it's taking so long. She even calls back to clarify my career path narrative to better advocate for me.
Today: Rejection. I don't even make it to the hiring manager interview round.

Her feedback: ""You interviewed perfectly,"" ""you're a flawless communicator,"" ""no negative feedback,"" but ""they went with what met their needs.""

Here's what's driving me insane:
Why would an external recruiter (who only gets paid on placement):

-Spend 60+ minutes screening me instead of the standard 30?
-Call me proactively before our scheduled call?
-Advocate to present me at higher salary?
-Check in with me multiple times over 2 weeks?
-Call back to clarify details to strengthen my case?
-Tell me I ""interviewed perfectly""...

...only for me to not even get to the first actual interview with the hiring manager?

The recruiter said: ""I'm not the decision maker unfortunately, they had to go with what met the needs of the department.""

I get that internal candidates exist. I get that budget constraints exist. I get that politics happen.

But what I don't get is: How does someone ""interview perfectly"" with ""no negative feedback"" but not warrant even ONE conversation with the actual hiring manager?

If I wasn't going to get past the resume review stage, why invest all that time? 

Am I crazy for feeling completely led on? What was even the point of all that?

On my resume, one of my jobs isn't totally real. It is and isn't. I worked for a construction company for over a year but they terminated me. The office politics were so unprofessional I do not want them on my resume. I seriously dont trust them at all to follow privacy laws (I actually was terminated for professionally confronting the manager about violating my privacy)

My husband had his own side buisness with a friend for a couple years. I did not some administrative stuff for him but it was not a full time position. Since it is also construction,  I just removed the other job from my resume and put his company and I am honest that it was a family buisness.  He obviously also didn't pay me.

Everything else is true, but the one thing I wonder if its holding me back is this job I quit after 5 months. I was being bullied by the only coworker in the office. My boss never came in cause of my coworker and the other got to work from home because of her. They openly admitted she was a problem but ""didn't know what to do."" So I quit because my mental health was depleted and finished a college program I had started. 

I am now looking for a job and I have a diploma in Recreation, 5 years administrative experience and now a Office Administration Certificate,  yet I cant find anything.

I recently had my first interview (L1) with the Director of the Salesforce team at Capgemini Netherlands for a Salesforce Engineer role focused on the Financial Services Industry. The conversation went well, and now I’ve been invited to the next round (L2), which will be a technical interview with a team member.

Need some guidance and tips:

* What kind of technical or scenario-based questions should I expect in this round?
* Will it be more focused on hands-on Salesforce engineering topics (Apex, integrations, CI/CD, data modeling, Service Cloud, etc.) or project-based discussions?

Any insights or shared experiences would be super helpful

I haven't been unemployed since pre-2018 and got retrenched/laid off in Sept because they couldn't afford to keep me on anymore, so this is all new to me. 

What happened to just... having normal interviews? I don't even see the point of having to record an introductory video anyway. But now because I'm desperate, I'm doing them regardless. What's the point of them? Is it to filter out bots, or determine if you're a native English speaker? Is it about looks or skin colour? 

Anyway, I now have to get ready for an ""interview"" which isn't actually an interview with a person. Apparently there will be multiple questions and I have to record a video answering each question. They're like ""it'll only take 16 minutes!"" except you need to rerecord more than once because they only allow 30-second videos and you might not answer properly the first time and it takes forever for them to upload, oh and then the file is too big! So you have to compress them a few times just to get them down to size and then upload again and then next thing you know, it's been over an hour.

It feels like they're making it harder to get hired these days, as if they won't just fire you or throw you away out of nowhere for whatever reason. Like if we're so dispensable and they can cycle employees out faster than they go through toilet paper, why put so much effort into hiring? 

It's SO much work and a lot of it is repeated multiple times throughout the process. You hit apply and have to fill out a form, then you have to record a video, then you have to meet with a recruiter who asks the same questions from the first form, then you meet with the hiring manager who asks the same questions from the first form, then you meet with someone else and answer the same questions, then in my case have to do an assessment/assignment, then you meet with the CEO or founder and answer the same questions. Literally what is the point of so many repeated steps?

Before we start a request : This is just a friendly discussion so can we not take out pitchforks? if you guys have any questions just ask. I welcome you to💛

Anyway let me introduce myself. I’m Zajey, Chaos incarnate. CEO / leader / Founder of Zajey Consultancy (yeah yeah. big deal. on a serious note I just started and it's all me)

So the Backstory. I’m from Mauritius and I’ve been Trying to find a Job. at First it was okay. got an Interview (yay) But then they ghosted me. no big deal. Contacted HR on 5 diff Days. no big Deal again. but the More I kept Trying to Find a job the Worse things Got until I realized it was all based upon Prejudice and not Skills and that the first one was a lucky shot. if you can call it that. The issues I encountered were

* Ghosted
* no Reply
* Dead HR lines
* “we’ll get back to you” (fucking bane of my existence)
* exorbitant experiences
* Bad Hours

And a lot of others.

so I felt bad and hopeless but more than that I began feeling fear. why? cause ”wait…so you’re telling me that someone like ME can’t find a job? despite those being mega easy for me???” then I realized the Issue was bigger than me when I ran into this subreddit and saw what you guys were dealing with.

y’all take the Cake though. yeah fr. Right. now onto the plan.

Zajey consultancyyyy

Basically it was my attempt at a Freelancing Gig. which…yeahhhhh didn’t turn out well. not my fault. it’s mauritius. I have a long list of proof but this ain’t that discussion. anyway I decided to give it another spin and this time use it to Hire people and convert “unskilled” labor into people with experience.

it’s not hard at all. basically I give them tasks and things to do. they deliver and they add to their portfolio what they do. plus I simulate actual Demands and deadlines and corpo ways so they can practice.

HOWEVER. the best thing is that there’s no consequences here. If they are late or anything I will go “yo. taking you a long time. your boss might be mad if you did that in a corpo” and have them do it faster by optimizing their Workflow.

what if they find a job and wanna leave? cool. they can go. I’m thankful they helped me while they could and would enjoy if they can help once in a while but that’s okay we understand and support our workers.

Flexible work time, Flexible work Schedule. the whole point is that you do the Job in your own way and get it done and deliver. this will be added to your portfolio and resume which will be Legit references in your job seeking torment.

the only rule at Zajey consultancy is being nice and doing something. like yeah that’s it no grandiose “we value-” bla bla bla. no no. we ACTUALLY mean it here.

“The money Zajey WHERE IS IT” right the Elephant in the room. currently there’s no Capital or big office BUT HOWEVER using the help of the people I’m planning to use that to build up opportunities to make money and myself gain experiences which I can use to get clout and eventually grow into something Bigger and be able to start off businesses and my ZAC education system to help more people get opportunities to Learn and Find jobs in a Flexible way without all the Rigid Systems and Crazy Requirements. AND affordable.

“so where do we come in into this??” not financially. while that would be cool I’m pretty sure we all broke here.

what you can do is advise me and help me push forward. You guys have one thing I don’t which Is Experience and perspective on things which I do not and using those Tips and experience I believe we can make a Difference.

If my ZAC System takes off here we can push it in other countries and Help make a Change for the better no?

“That’s CRAZY.”

duh yeah but Reddit has done crazy things before with the Gamestop thing and what not. Why can’t we do this for the job system in a Very LEGAL AND NICE way without anything reckless. just pure business dealing and Education.

Summary.

So yeah I’d love to get the support of you Guys on this Journey.

“yo yo before you go what was it about that Messiah thing?” a lot of Subreddit seem to have a messiah. Current one is “Chive Lord” other times it was something else. I want to be a big shot of a sub and I was wondering If I could Fit in here cause all of us are in the same Soup😅😅

so yeah that sums it up

recruitinghell,1ouri3l,2025-11-12T01:10:52+00:00,46,50,This is how I finally got a new job:,"After a few months of applying for a better paying job with hundreds of applications and attending interviews this is what got me the a job (for more pay and better conditions): 

I paid someone to write my CV. You might think it’s a waste of time and crazy. Probably was. I did everything I could to tweak my CV and held off for as long as possible. Re-wrote it about 10 times and tried to tailor it. Eventually got fed up of barely getting an interview so paid for a professional service. 

I gave them all of my skills and day to day roles in great detail and explained exactly what I was looking for, and someone re-wrote it within days, giving me multiple chances to correct or ask them to tweak anything. They made me seem way more professional than I could have articulated, and used key words and skills that were broad enough to cover multiple job areas without me having to tweak it for individual jobs, but still kept it in the professional/admin fields I was looking for. 

This allowed me to send it out to multiple people via quick apply and was suprised how quickly I started getting interviews. (NOT an AD and you don’t have to do this part and can tailor your own CV manually if you prefer).

I created a separate email for all of my jobs so that I could reply to recruiters and companies quickly and not get confused with jobs I’d applied for and keep me organised with attending interviews. (I have ADHD so struggle with this). 

Quick apply does work, but you have to be realistic and make sure that their job description day to day role hits as many of your CV skills as possible or at least highly transferable and apply for as many of those jobs as possible. Also, try to stick to jobs advertised in the first 24 hours to 3 days otherwise you won’t get seen. You want to get in there and noticed before anyone else.
I quick applied for about 30 a day across multiple platforms, and then did 5 proper detailed applications for the jobs I really wanted with the STAR method.

Sometimes I would type paragraphs of my star answers with what I was trying to get across based on all of my skills and the job description and input it all into ChatGPT/AI and ask them to tidy it up and make it more concise based on the role I was applying for (which I would also send). (Btw I am NOT saying let AI write it for you, just neaten up your own words and then edit it after slightly to be less robotic). This also helped me cut down on time too.

It’s a numbers game and really does work. You have to treat it like a real job and spend hours applying for as many as you can. Then the next day I would get at least 2-3 recruiters messaging me and the ball started rolling. I didn’t bother creating a LinkedIn or “networking” with recruiters as it appeared hit or miss.

I also did a few qualifications on the side (offered by my current job, but you can find some good ones online and some that let you pay instalments) to boost my skills and added them to my applications as well. I didn’t spend too much time on applications though as I didn’t want to over think it and usually ended up getting knowhere when I tried too hard. I never used a cover letter for any of my applications either and it didn’t stop me getting interviews. 

I fluffed up certain words in my CV. For example, for a customer advisor you could put client advisor. You aren’t lying, just making it seem more professional as a title but with the same duties.

I quantified what I did say to day and how it benefited the company positively in all of my roles and made sure I focused on what I brought to the table and not just what I do day to day. Also make sure you scrap references on your CV. Waste of time and space. And triple check for any spelling, formatting or contact detail errors and no fancy over the top formatting or fonts.

In the interview I didn’t over prep in one go but did short general prep every day. I had about 10 random STAR word scenarios in my head from my day to day job and picked the best ones that got me to further stages in an interview and practiced those day to day in the mirror so during interviews it came across more natural and less rehearesed. 

I spent a lot of time researching each company before an interview. Mainly their core values and if they did any other things like volunteering and would bring that up in the interview in line with my hobbies if they asked me if I had any. For example, I told them I knit and donated scarves in my current job as we also do volunteering, and then would slide in that I knew this company also did volunteering or ask if they had anything like that in line with their values. 

I was professional but also really chatty in a calm way so they could envision me fitting in well with them and made mild friendly basic jokes and asked more questions about their company and culture. Don’t overdo it but keep it natural and friendly and seem genuinely interested in their company and culture. Even if you have to fake it a bit. 

If they ask a weakness, always pick something that isn’t in the job role. For example if you’re applying as a data analyst, you could say you sometimes talk too fast. Always follow it up with how you have rectified it and how it improved your role and performance. 

If they ask why you’re leaving a company, never bad mouth your employer even slightly. Lie. I would always say that I was looking to progress in my career and loved the culture and fit of the new company and felt I’d be a great fit (here you can bring up some core values or research you’ve done) and keep their focus on the future not your past. 

Finally ALWAYS ask questions at the end, such as what kind of culture fit they are looking for, what areas of the business/role are the most in demand and busy, and what they are looking for in terms of progression. I learnt that they love it when you give them a chance to talk about themselves or the company and this is now their stage to shine a bit. 

Give them a firm handshake and deep smile at the end and have proper eye contact with all people in the interviews equally and make sure you thank everyone individually. And don’t chase them up after the interview. If they like you, they won’t forget you.

Hope this helps at least one person and good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ouri3l/this_is_how_i_finally_got_a_new_job/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ouri3l/this_is_how_i_finally_got_a_new_job/

I am in school and need to take on another part time job to make ends meet and have extra money in case, but I have been rejected and straight up ghosted for months. I have been applying to retail positions because everything i have experience in and would have a high chance of getting are all full time, which i cant commit to considering my school schedule.

After getting rejected, I finally got a callback from a franchise for two different locations. I interviewed at the first one, and it was a group interview. They didn't have enough space to interview us all, so we had to stand in a random place in the mall, super noisy and right next to music, and no one could hear each other. The manager didn't even take notes. Still got rejected. 

The second location interview went better, and I left feeling good about it. Waited a few days and heard nothing. Followed up, still nothing. I have been ghosted. There's no online portal to check for updates, its literally just an ai chat bot, so the only way I can get updates is by emailing the hiring manager. Who is currently not answering me.

i started hard-looking for another job in january. i’ve gone through round after round of interviews only for them to hire internally or go with another candidate after the final round. 

my most recent blunder and i’d love to know your opinions: 

started interviewing with a company 2 months ago (september 9th). position pays 75k a year. interviews have been as follows: 

1. company recruiter 30 min phone call 

2. direct manager 1.5 hours teams call 

3. department upper management 1.5 hours teams call 

4. in-person with direct manager, department upper management (who didn’t show up because “her dog was sick” and then questioned why i wasn’t prepared with a laptop in case it needed to be a teams meeting), and 2 people already working the position (total of 4 people) 

5. didn’t get back to me for 3 weeks - after me harassing with phone calls and emails scheduled another interview with head of department - 45 min teams meeting, was told decision would be made by EOW

6. 3 weeks no contact, finally called department head’s mobile and he advised they’d been on vacation and traveling, direct manager wants to speak again - another 30 min call with direct manager (3rd interview with her) yesterday - was asked what management style i like best, job duties from 13 years ago, if i’m interviewing with other companies and “how’s that going”. can’t give me a timeframe, says there are “a lot of decision makers” and they’d “like to get someone in before the first of the new year”.

recruitinghell,1ougoeg,2025-11-11T18:07:16+00:00,16,31,Had a techie interview with someone who basically told me autistic people are smarter than non-autistic people. I'm not autistic.,"Oh boy, where do I begin?

I interviewed for a pretty decent tech job. The phone interview overall went well. I usually do pretty well with interviews, since I have relatively good people skills for someone in STEM.

I have ADHD, but as far as most people are concerned, I'm a normie. It only really comes out when my RSD comes up against someone lacking social skills, who are typically either autistic or have personality disorders, and aren't managing their empathy issues well. That's just something for me to manage most of the time, but I do notice that working under autistic people just doesn't work for me.

So this recruiter tells me about some other dude he's interviewing, who won't look in the camera or make eye contact. He goes on some tangent about ""how people in tech are,"" which I totally get, after having to work around other STEM people's lack of social skills for years. He takes it step further though and says something like ""you almost have to be autistic to be smart enough for this job.""

I hate, hate, HATE this trope about autistic people being super geniuses. I feel like I've had to fight my entire life to get people to understand two things:

\- Being smart doesn't make you autistic.

\- Being autistic doesn't make you smart. 

People who didn't know me well as a kid would always treat me as some uber nerd. As an adult, it's more about dealing with people in STEM who think I'm dumb and don't take my work seriously because I don't look or act like a weirdo. 

So as I said, the interview went well aside from this, but this shit is sticking in my head. It's disgusting to me on a level deeper than just the apparent ableism, because I feel like I've been fighting this stupid stereotype my entire life.

For all the recruiters here, autism DOES NOT make people better at STEM. I've worked with a number of autistic people. They are just as talented as anyone else, no less and no more. Likewise, stop giving people a pass for a lack of social skills, y'all are letting people in who lack both technical AND social skills, on the the assumption that the lack of social skills implies they're smarter.

Anyways, I left the field that I had been in for over 10 years in May of this year. I started my new role with a company and at first things seemed okay but it quickly went downhill. Founder’s syndrome in full effect. There were legal, compliance, and financial issues I couldn’t ignore. So I found a new role in by original field. I was only at that role for about 6 months before I left.

I am on day 5 at my new role which is in the industry that I have many years of experience in. On day 3, which happens to be a Friday night, I receive a call at the very end of the day (like 7pm) from my boss who is clearly upset with me and says another employee who I had talked to the day prior made some comments about things I said to her. I try to explain that I did not say those things as there must have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding and that I would be happy to reach out and clarify with the other employee. She tells me no to just “let it go” and then ends the call. I sent a text apologizing for the issues, even though I don’t believe I did anything wrong, and she doesn’t respond. This had me spiraling all weekend. 

Then on Monday we schedule a call and I am told that it is no longer okay for me to talk to the other employees. That all communication needs to go through my boss because she is afraid of what I will say…. My role is a people manager… I have only talked to one employee except for the person who is my bosses right hand person and has been training me. So I am on day 5 and I am not even allowed to reach out to my coworkers to even introduce myself to them we are fully remote. She forwarded me an email from one employee from before I started and it specifically mentions that I will be able to help move the project forward. When I ask her if I could reach out to determine how I could help, she sent me a multiple paragraph email outlining that she only wants me focused on these specific tasks and that she only sent the email as an FYI.

Am I being gas lighted? (Is that how you say it)… She mentioned to me after she sent me my offer that she connected with someone from her past who applied for the role that I got but she hired me because of my experience in the industry but that this person has a lot of experience. On Friday, she actually met with this person and they are onboarding into a fractional role now, very similar to what I was hired to do. Is she trying to phase me out? There was clearly a shift in her attitude toward me on Friday. How do I salvage the fact that I have had two short roles this year, if I do have to start looking again? I feel like a total failure.

Also, the thing that was supposedly said was that I thought the individual I was talking to, who is a managing partner, should be managing everyone on the team. And that I didn’t understand why the team was split up into two teams. Which I did say I didn’t understand the split but I didn’t not say that the MP should manage everyone. I just started, day two and didn’t know these people. How could I make that call?

Sorry this is so long but I don’t know what to do.

Meanwhile, tons of genuinely skilled people freeze up, sound robotic, or blank out mid-sentence because of nerves.  
They leave the interview kicking themselves, thinking, “Why can’t I just sound like I know what I know?”

Honestly, it feels unfair.  
We train for years to get good at our work — but no one ever teaches you how to **perform under stress** in a high-stakes interview.

Curious, does anyone else feel like the system rewards *performance over ability*?

The PD was weird about it so I left the meeting feeling like maybe this wasn’t going anywhere. A few days later I get an email from HR asking me for extensive info/fingerprints to run a background check. It’s a public job and I work in the public sector anyway so I’m used to crazy background checks. But is this sequence of hiring steps normal?

recruitinghell,1otrba8,2025-11-10T21:56:37+00:00,0,0,"Here's my top 10 worst things I hate about job search related stuff, like on indeed, etc.","\#1 When jobs advertise a listing as if they are a company when they are actually a temp agency

\#2 When said temp agency's job listing is actually for a place you would never in a million years want to work for

\#3 When job listing says ""No Degree Needed"" then you get to the end of the application and there's some super specific required experience even though the job itself is so simple a baby could do it

\#4 Temp agencies posting job positions, often in multiple, that don't actually exist but are jobs ""they typically hire people for"" just to get you to sign up with them on the 0.00001% chance you might actually have signed up at the right time to get said job type.

\#5 Listings that claim (or are secretive about) that they are not what they say they are---for example Heavy industrial job posting as ""Light"" industrial because their production peices individually don't weigh that much, which is not what light industrial is, it means light duty not light weight. If you put 500 1lb parts in a box, then the person still is stacking 500lbs, this kind of borderline stuff ticks me off to no end.

\#6 (might actually be #1 sometimes) Job listings that say they are in my town and are halfway across the planet, or in the next state over, or some crap like that. Though, I have trained my brain to autofilter those to some degree

These are probably my bad luck but they are still annoying:

\#7 after days and days of waiting finally get one response... then once someone hires, every single listing reponds all at once

\#8 When I get a really good job offer, then another really good job offer that *sounds* better, and now I'm stuck wondering which I should actually take, I think I will end up going ""for the money"" and then find out it was too good to be true (the real reason they pay more...) but the other job might be long gone... it's a vicious back and forth wondering which job to pick, sometimes there's even more than two.  Then you get hired, find out after a few days you can't even do the job or it was completely wrong for you, and now you have to start over.

\#9 Companies that do *everything* in the hiring process using automation, I hate these. And they always have stupid rules like ""You need at least one reference who happens to be a chicken breeder that lives exactly 777 miles northwest of you whom wears a pink hat at least half the week""

\#10 when they REDIRECT you to *their* website to do some nonstandard application process.... or worse a redirection to their actual job listings, and worst redirection to job listings and they don't even have any in your area.

If you read this far, I'll give you a bonus:

\#11 employers that call you but sound like they are reading from a script, or barely can speak english, usually combined with #6, these jobs either have high turnover or low hire rate but such a large applicant rate that the hiring process is done by a separate company UGH. 

For you people new being interviewed, I have posted some tips here on reddit a couple/few days ago, [here's the post if you are interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1os2aes/job_search_tips_from_someone_who_has_done_it_a_ton/).

The recruiter spent 20 of those 30 minutes talking about irrelevant details in their own lives and were constantly THRILLED about insignificant stuff that we happened to have in common…like hair color and broad-stroke general interests. We didn’t actually have either in common, they just got so excited that we MIGHT have it in common….like we were in junior high interviewing to be besties.

They barely read the position’s description, and they didn’t read my resume. So, those 10 minutes I got a word in edgewise were them asking me to remind them what was already on the resume. Since they didn’t understand the finer points of the job’s requirements, they were overly impressed with basics and never gave me the opportunity to explain what sets me APART from other candidates. But they kept going back to the “neat” similarities they had been excited about previously…like how their boss and I are from the same state. Now they’re going back to their supervisor gushing over how much fun they had talking to me but can’t say anything extra to recommend me for the job I was perfect for. I’m sure there were other great candidates too, and if they were interviewed by my recruiter, they might be sol. It’ll just be luck over who made the recruiter feel happiest that day. 

I wish companies knew that they’re missing good candidates because their recruitment teams are terrible. This has happened to me several times. Once it happened to a friend who got the job only to find out that the staffing was so haphazard, and moral was so terrible, because personelle only cared about ice breaker games, expensive freebies in the break room (to make them look more successful than they were), and throwing parties on the company’s dime. Then they’d fire 5-10 people every quarter to pay for it. No one qualified enough was being hired. They were hiring based on how much fun the first interview chat was. 

Dear recruiters:

 -initial get-to-know-you pleasantries are fine but they shouldn’t take 2/3 of the interview time. They certainly shouldn’t be one-sided. You don’t need to play icebreaker games after you’re already acquainted. We’re interviewing for a job, not a coffee buddy. 

-we only have a certain amount of time in our days too. It’s just as rude to waste our time as it is for us to waste yours.

-please don’t waste the little opportunity we get to talk to a real person on stuff unrelated to the job. We can email about extra stuff later. You don’t need that to remember that movie you wanted to tell me about as much as I need to tell you why I’d be good at the job.

You ever notice how the jobs you don’t even apply to practically send you a W-2 in advance, but the one you actually want suddenly becomes NASA level selective?

Like, I just went through three interviews for a junior role, literally made for someone who’s learning. They said they have “lots of seats to fill,” told me “we train you on loans,” hyped me up with all the “growth opportunity” talk.

Each interviewer liked me, final guy even said he sees himself in me. He’s nodding, talking about how he was in the same spot once, how I’ve got the mindset and drive, “you’re a good fit, man.”

Then boom. “We decided to move forward with other candidates.”

THE FUCK YOU MEAN OTHER CANDIDATES??  
You said it was junior, you said training included, you said lots of seats.

Why do I feel like they’re just collecting interviews for sport at this point?

And the craziest part? At 18 I already had a job as a Floor Manager, saved my money, bought a BMW, moved out, switched to sales, moved into accounting, and I’m trying to actually advance my life at 22. But somehow recruiters act like I’m just not *allowed* to. Like they’re gatekeeping adulthood until I hit some invisible age requirement.

The job I didn’t want called me twice to make sure I got the offer letter, but the one I wanted/had a “spiritual connection” with me just to hit me with the “we wish you the best in your career endeavors” text.

Maybe it was a bad idea saying I see myself becoming my own boss in 5–7 years when they asked where I see myself in the future. Maybe it's because I said I would become a leadership role before that 5-year mark and they thought that was egotistical. Maybe it's because I told them I'm interested in loans because I myself have been looking for one to start a small business, and having the opportunity to help others do what I want to do is something I can be passionate about. I did notice after I mentioned a side business they started asking about my availability. I said the business is passive income, and I don’t plan on diving deep into that once I’m employed, but currently I’m unemployed and looking for ways to get money. All these statements are why this young buck said he connected with me, but clearly he didn’t, and it was all a façade or maybe jealousy. Honestly no idea, but pissed because it really seemed like something I could’ve done passionately as I already had experience in the field. Now I guess I can make light of this, and I could say all this recruiting BS is teaching me to go for it and be my own boss.....

I had gotten a job (one year after HS graduation) at a local thrift store chain, which had mediocre pay (like $10 an hour, fine pay for being entry but sucks otherwise), and tended to be a lot of busywork and pretending to be busy when you had nothing to do. But the supervisors and managers were nice enough and gave basic okay training for other jobs.

The problem was, it was a temporary position where they want you to leave asap. They miraculously were willing to keep me for 18 months because I was good enough, but they had a deadline for when I had to find another job. I didn't search that much because the process is stressful. But ten days ago is when they let me go for good. So now I need to find someplace to stay until I can get into college

I applied somewhere before that (I have been using Indeed to find decent openings), but they just randomly stopped considering me, no reason given, they never even emailed or called me. So now I only have one last place I'll probably try to apply to today, and if that fails, I'm not sure what to do. All I can try is applying for unemployment benefits

Think about it a candidate can enter a HackerRank or CoderPad session, have AI quietly assist with logic, syntax, and even edge case fixes, and potentially pass the interview with flying colors. This isn’t science fiction; it’s happening.

This advancement raises an important question: If AI can solve problems faster, more cleanly, and with fewer errors, what exactly are we testing in interviews anymore?

The interview system was already flawed. Interview questions often have little to do with real-world engineering. Success relies more on how well you can memorize LeetCode problems than on your ability to design systems or debug collaboratively with a team. Additionally, half of the outcome depends on whether you “click” with the interviewer.

Now, with AI entering the equation, the illusion of fairness completely collapses. If everyone starts using tools like Interview Coder (and let’s be honest, they will), do companies need to evolve beyond puzzle-based hiring?

1. My internship experience has been overall good. There were plenty of bumps in the beginning but as time has gone on I have built a good caseload. The culture is great, positive, supportive, and run my therapists. I have the opportunity to continue seeing my clients with a smooth transition. Their base compensation is lower than other places at about 63 and hour based on billable encounters only. Case load of 22 to 25 slots a week, 50% coverage of insurance,PTO, sick leave, M. Leave, bilingual differential per billable hour, 401k match, CEU and they are willing to be flexible with scheduling. They have a transparent wage yearly increase and it is okay.
2. The other place will also allow me to see the client population i want, flexible schedule within the limitations of office space available, about 70 per billable hour with a smaller bilingual differential, stipend for health plan you want, wage increase are discussed every year, although I don't know the rate, 401k match, and I would have to start from scratch or take my clients over. 

Both sites provide supervision for free. 1 is a bigger agency and 2 is smaller private practice. The main difference are in 1. Has a more built in infrastructure and 2 is more independent.

I have rejected quite a few interviews after the first interview just cause it wasnt a good fit imo.
I've made it to 2 final round interviews, I got rejected from 1 (saw that they reposted the job posting and emailed in, received the HR rejection email, asked if they could give me feedback about it, ghosted), and another has ghosted me for 2 weeks now.

Both of which I had to do a technical assessment. It was very obvious they were chatgpt assignment because it was lacking in providing so much information and the time assumed (1-2hours) is definitely not enough for the assignment requirements. I had to create presentation decks with processes and graphs on top of the in person presentation after. It took me at least a day+ individually for both assignments.

For jobs where I get ghosted after the first interview, I get it. But why do hiring teams simply just ghost you without response if you had made it all the way to the end? The irony is the company that had ghosted me for 2 weeks now – the hiring team gave me their personal numbers and linkedin to connect because they acknowledged how difficult the job market is and saw the value i brought and wanted to stay in touch regardless of the result. Of course I would be bumped about not getting an offer, but it stings more especially in the first week of anticipation and they havent gotten back to you. And you send a follow up email, just to be ghosted again.

There was only ONE company, where the HR kept updating me of their decisions and timeline, and even sent me a rejection email after a second round interview with feedback about how I just wasnt someone they were looking for at the time. And this HR lady isnt even based locally!!!! 

I have other interviews lined up already and I'm not going to keep brooding over this. But I just think if you make someone do a whole ass assessment and give a presentation, and meet in person, the very least is to just send an automated rejection email if anything so I could just move on with my life.

recruitinghell,1otd5ne,2025-11-10T13:02:46+00:00,158,50,I get so annoyed,"When someone is complaining about the job market and someone in the comments (not always Reddit, it happens everywhere) leaves a comment about how smart they were to avoid the rat race and then go into trades or start a business or leave the US and how they’re financially comfortable and will never need to worry about the job market again. 

Cool! Good for you! This isn’t about you! 

A) not everyone can run a business. Even without the start-up capital, you’re working every waking moment of your life. My mom owned her own business and there was never a moment where she wasn’t working (though she did occasionally take a break from working to scream at and hit her children). I don’t want to spend my 80 years of life on the grind. Plus, if everyone starts a business, who will work in said businesses? 

B) “You should go into the trades” is the 2025 version of “You should learn to code” and give it ten years and then we’ll run into this problem again. A thriving society cannot have its entire population jumping from one industry to another for the promise of some cash. 

C) Most of us will never be able to leave the US permanently. Emigration requires capital, and special skills, and not being disabled. I’m glad you got out! But your comments saying, “Just move out of the US” are useless. What country is going to accept disabled immigrants and put them on the government’s payroll?! Where can I go?! Who will hire me?! 

I think it’s just the smugness that gets to me. “Ha! You are all struggling? Well, I’m super smart and amazing and I don’t need to struggle.” 

Cool. Good for you. Get out of the comment section.

This chat bot is called Bits AI, **costs £10/month,** and it is a different app and subscription to the main Bits one. 

They are hiring front-end developers in London for the app. One week after applying with LinkedIn EasyApply, and with no other previous interaction, they emailed a take-home assignment.

This assignment, which is a 2-page DOCX file, asks to download the Bits AI app and go throw the different user flows (*onboarding, chat, categorising transactions, check my credit*), note down first impressions, suggest 3-5 product/UX improvements, and pick 1 of these improvements to specify a concrete solution with mock-ups as screenshots or Figma-like web documents.

This assignment is 100% UX/UI knowledge with 0% front-end (no programming, JavaScript, React, etc questions). In the LinkedIn ad, the email, and the assignment file, it always refers to this role as frontend. The assignment says:

>*We’re looking for a front-end engineer who doesn’t just code—but thinks like a product designer and user.*

In order to actually use the app and go beyond the *Sign in/Sign up* screen (and hence be able to fulfil the take-home assignment) **you need to enrol in a paid subscription and provide a credit card number.** No credit card provided, no way to use the app.

This subscription does not use the Google Play mechanism, which at least allows cancelling subscriptions anytime from the Google Play app. It uses Stripe to set credit card payments, and the only way to cancel the subscription is by sending an email to hello@getbits.app.

The hiring manager is, according to his LinkedIn profile, a 20-year future 2029 Harvard graduate (doesn’t specify which degree), whose job title is ‘Product Manager | Head of Product’. He joined Bits in June 2025 as an intern.

That a frontend developer is exclusively tested for UX/UI is unusual, but digestible. That the hiring manager is a 20-year boy with an inflated LinkedIn page, is, let’s say, a startup particularity. But the fact that you have to provide your credit card details and send emails to customer service to cancel a paid subscription just to proceed with a recruitment process is beyond professional tolerance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ot44zh/startup_bits_requests_candidates_to_create_a_paid/,https://reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ot44zh/startup_bits_requests_candidates_to_create_a_paid/

I’ve never had to spend this long actively applying and interviewing for jobs. The real mindfuck is I’ve actually never had so many interviews I was so confident went well. This week hit a new low and gave me something else to absolutely overthink. 

I had a second interview for a basic retail small shop selling age restricted products. It was a very laid back, not super professional interview process. I am knowledgeable about the products and industry and have many personal connections in that industry. It went great with the first individual. I was immediately called back to interview with a second individual- the person who originally called me and handled all contact via phone with me and had several chances to hear me speak. The second interview went fine - it’s getting hard to tell with how tough it is right now but that’s beside the point. But then, at the end of the second interview, the guy said he just had one last question, he said it had nothing to do with the job and he was just curious. He went on to ask about my voice. He was struggling to find the words but the one thing he did manage to ask was “is it something neurological?” Then he said they would let me know by the end of the week and surprise surprise, they didn’t call me back.

I am a central/Gulf coast Florida native. I have no neurological disorder or disability. I have am female and have a somewhat deep voice, I’ve received comments, questions and compliments before. Frequent comparisons include - a California accent, a surfer/skater/stoner/valley girl. I’ve heard Daria. Ben Stein. Once, a complete stranger in a different part of Florida pegged the exact city I am from based on my “accent”. I sound like my sister, my mother, my father, my uncle, my aunts on both sides. I don’t stutter or mispronounce words or have any speech issues. I don’t have a heavy southern accent or any “traditional” accent. I’ve worked in professional office and legal settings. I’ve worked customer/client service and sales, I’ve worked on phones all day, I can certainly speak to all kinds of people.

I’d love to get an honest, detailed review of my resume. I’m currently working as a **Technical Support Engineer**, and I have around **4 years of experience** spanning **technical support, software engineering, and cloud projects**.

I have a **BA in Information Technology** and I’m interested in pivoting toward **Technology Consulting roles** at firms like **PwC, KPMG, EY, Deloitte, or Accenture** etc— ideally within **Cloud, Digital Transformation, or IT Implementation consulting tracks etc**.

I’ve reworked my resume to highlight both my **technical background (AWS, CI/CD, Swift, troubleshooting)** and **consulting-related skills (client communication, solution delivery, process improvement)**. I’d like feedback on how well it markets me for consulting roles versus pure technical positions.

**A bit more context:**

* **Applying to:** U.S.-based roles (open to both local and remote opportunities, and willing to relocate for the right role).
* **Goal:** Transition from hands-on technical roles (software/support) into technology consulting (cloud transformation, implementation, or IT operations).
* **Challenges:** Unsure if my resume reads as too technical or too support-focused for consulting positions also I feel like in the past my resume has kept getting rejected from ATS system, so my current process that I do to apply to role is I have a master resume which I tailor to the role and check for ATS Score if its above 85 I'll submit,I understand the market is horrible but I rather make sure all me stuff is proper to at least give me a fighting chance.
* **What I’d like feedback on:**
   * How well does my resume align with Big 4 consulting roles?
   * Are there any sections (summary, experience, or skills) that could better emphasize consulting value?
   * Any formatting or content suggestions to make it more recruiter-friendly for these roles?
   * I have more skills and product I've used but I've shorten down to these.
   * Also side question, I had couple thought what I want to pivot my career to I would love to hear you thought about it, so my option I thought was Technology Consulting, DevOps, something in Cloud or something in CyberSecurity.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review it — I’d really appreciate honest, constructive feedback!

recruitinghell,1org0rd,2025-11-08T04:23:14+00:00,3,2,Got close to the summit and fell trying getting out of underemployment.,"
Hey all.

I recently spent a month pursuing a social media creator/manager opportunity with a small indie game studio, and I have my first denial after a final interview.

A bit about me: I have a creative background (theater, video production) and some professional marketing experience. I’m also a video game speedrunner with plenty of experience in front of large physical and digital audiences. I also have grown and run my own gaming content brand on TikTok, where I’ve grown audiences and created content that when things went viral, have reached peaks for 30-60k views. 

I spent the last month chasing what looked like the perfect social media/creator role with a small indie game studio. They said they wanted someone to make content, manage social channels, grow the community and discord, etc. Basic stuff.

The process was relatively fast. They opened the listing second week of october, I got first contact about 2 weeks later, then screened 2 days later, then interviewed the beginning of the following week.

My interview focused a lot of strategies I had developed and things that I assumed they wanted to hear. I pitched multiple series of videos, turning the events that are happening in the discord already with a small audience into livestream-able content, and creating just overall good ideas. They were interested in this, but I probably should have had a red flag up when I heard “There may be room for you here as a creator.” I asked a ton about where the game was at, what success is defined in this role, etc. The overall vibe was that they just wanted someone who can take the reins and go, they didn’t have metrics or kpi’s or deliverables in mind.

Cut to today, when after getting really excited the day before, receiving a “next steps” message and a meeting about how to “utilize my strengths.” I got hit with:

	•	“You seem too focused on making content and being on-camera.”
	•	“You don’t have the traditional experience we’re looking for.”
	
And then a long winded discussion about how they would love to have me as an influencer, but it would be them boosting my posts, and they have no clear influencer contract or even IDEA of what works or what their strategy looks like. 

So anyways, I’m back to square one on some of my leads, and now it’s battling the holiday slowdown to escape underemployment.

Rant over.

recruitinghell,1orfpim,2025-11-08T04:06:43+00:00,307,59,Illusion of “doing everything right”,"“Stay in school”
“Go to college”
“Get a good career”
“Climb the corporate ladder”

Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

Then one day it’s:
“Unfortunately, your role was impacted”
“We’ve decided to move forward with another candidate”
“We’re looking for someone with more direct experience”

Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

They told me if I followed the rules, I’d be safe. But the rules were written for people who already had safety.

My parents came here with nothing. They worked themselves raw so I wouldn’t have to start from the same place they did. And yet here I am. College degree in hand back at square one. Not surviving off factory shifts, but still hustling to prove I deserve to exist. Just a different version of the same fight.

They tell you “your network is the key to your next role” but my LinkedIn messages sit unopened. They say “trust the process” but what process? The one that rewards luck and punishes exhaustion?

It’s crazy af how some people will never have to think about rent or groceries after a layoff. Never have to pray an interview goes right just to keep healthcare.

Fuck billionaires.
Fuck AI.

And fuck whoever decided our worth should be tied to productivity.

Still, I’ll never forget this feeling. 

The world didn’t end, but something in me shifted.
I saw how fragile everything is, how fast stability turns into survival.
And maybe that’s the lesson: none of this was ever real security.

If I ever make it out of this cycle, I’m not climbing another fucking ladder. 
I’m building a world where being human is finally enough. 
After all, that’s all that matters at the end of all of this. 

On the bright side, I have Reddit.
